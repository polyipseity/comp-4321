<h1>Automated Keyword Classification for Information Retrieval </h1>
<p>This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussion <br>
of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their <br>
surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not a <br>
textbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice <br>
of topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide an <br>
elementary description of either. For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed <br>
that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information <br>
retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of <br>
retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that <br>
between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the <br>
use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example. Equally, <br>
in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of <br>
characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; <br>
but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, <br>
or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has <br>
raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of <br>
my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios. </p>
