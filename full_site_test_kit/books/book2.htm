<h1>Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases </h1>
<p><br>
This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of <br>
machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178). It <br>
is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared <br>
in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. <br>
The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications <br>
used in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered <br>
to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing <br>
bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). <br>
The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage <br>
and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or <br>
data base generation. <br>
The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First, <br>
data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic <br>
information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. <br>
Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number <br>
is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as <br>
that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) <br>
are excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material <br>
is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most <br>
of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a <br>
shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this <br>
chapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation <br>
of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production <br>
operation. </p>
