<h1>A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance </h1>
<p><br>
Recently a number of articles, books, and reports <br>
dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval <br>
systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems <br>
are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage <br>
of relevancy they provide. <br>
Although there seems to be little agreement on what <br>
relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, <br>
there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed <br>
and formal relationship exists between the relevance and <br>
the recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find <br>
in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of <br>
relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, <br>
curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide <br>
numerical measures of the recall and relevance <br>
characteristics of information systems. This phenomenon <br>
of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective <br>
and non-mathematical term to equations in which the <br>
same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical <br>
definition has its ancient parallel in discussions <br>
of probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the <br>
meaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, <br>
on &quot;who is master,&quot; the user or the term. On the other hand, <br>
the use of a single term in the same document to cover <br>
two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a <br>
usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine <br>
by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does <br>
not have, represents a more serious situation than merely <br>
careless ambiguity. </p>
