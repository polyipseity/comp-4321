<h1>PG Program</h1>
<p>Applicants for <a href="../ust_cse.htm">admission</a> to the postgraduate programs are required to have&nbsp; 
completed, by the time they enter HKUST, a bachelor's degree in computer science 
or a related science or engineering field. Students admitted to a postgraduate 
program must demonstrate competence in the following core computer science 
areas: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>Computer Organization 
	</li>
	<li>Principles of Programming Languages 
	</li>
	<li>Principles of Systems Software&nbsp; (Operating Systems) 
	</li>
	<li>Design and Analysis of Algorithms </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, students admitted into the PhD program must demonstrate 
competence in: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Theory of Computation </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
Competence in these areas is appraised during the admission process. A student 
whose formal computer science background is deemed inadequate in any of the 
above areas may be admitted on a provisional basis and will be required to take 
remedial courses prescribed by the Postgraduate Studies Committee and obtain a 
grade of at least B in these courses. Such additional requirements will be 
stipulated in the individual offer of admission. Deficiencies in any core 
computer science area can be made up concurrently with postgraduate work. </p>
<p>Applicants are required to submit: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>officially certified academic transcripts of undergraduate studies (and 
	postgraduate studies, if any); 
	</li>
	<li>results of the computer science subject Graduate Record (GRE) (required 
	for PhD applicants only; may be taken and submitted in the year after 
	admission); 
	</li>
	<li>results of an English proficiency test (see below); 
	</li>
	<li>two letters of recommendation: a one-page statement of plan for the 
	postgraduate study; and 
	</li>
	<li>a completed application form for postgraduate admission. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
For admission into the MSc and MPhil programs, results of standard examinations, 
such as the computer science subject Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be 
helpful in determining suitability for admission and should be submitted as 
supplementary information, if available. </p>
<p>All students admitted into a postgraduate program must demonstrate sufficient 
competence in English. Students whose previous degrees are from an institution 
where the primary language of instruction is other than English should submit 
the results of an English proficiency test (such as TOEFL) together with their 
application. The English proficiency test must have been taken within two years 
of the time of application. Notwithstanding the above, the Department may 
require newly admitted students to undergo language proficiency assessment and, 
if deemed necessary, to take English language enhancement courses. </p>
<p>Admission to the Department's postgraduate programs will be based on the 
applicant's academic record as well as the research needs of the Department. </p>
