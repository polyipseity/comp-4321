<h1>Program Information</h1>
<p>The Department of Computer Science at HKUST offers two degree 
<a href="../ust_cse.htm">programs</a> for 
students who are interested in learning about computing and information 
technology:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>1. COMP: BEng in Computer Science<br>
	</b>This is our general undergraduate program that provides broad education 
	in all areas of Computer Science.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>2. CSIE: BEng in Computer Science (Information Engineering)<br>
	</b>This is a specialized undergraduate degree program focusing on the areas 
	of multimedia computing and computer networking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While other Information Engineering programs in Hong Kong are closer to 
Electrical and Electronic Engineering, our CSIE program is unique in its 
emphasis on software. In fact, the CSIE program also satisfies all the general 
requirements of a typical Computer Science program. It has been carefully 
designed with the specific needs of Hong Kong in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, the Department, jointly with the Department of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineering, also offers the <b>BEng in Computer Engineering</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#12288;</p>
<h3>A Spectrum of IT-Related Programs</h3>
<p>The programs offered by our Department and the Department of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineering can be best viewed as the following spectrum:</p>
<p>Software&lt;-----------------------&gt;Hardware</p>
<p>COMP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSIE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPEG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EEIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ELEC</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the emphasis shifts from &quot;soft&quot; to &quot;hard&quot; as we move 
across the spectrum. The different programs suit different student interests and 
job market demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#12288;</p>
<h3>Other Opportunities</h3>
<p>Besides the regular study programs, Computer Science students at HKUST also 
enjoy a number of other opportunities, including the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><i>Overseas exchange program:</i><br>
	</b>One-year full-time overseas study by paying only HKUST's tuition fee&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Work-study program:</i><br>
	</b>One-year full-time work outside HKUST after two years of study 
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Industrial training:</i><br>
	</b>Training modules during winter and summer breaks on specific practical 
	skills&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li><b><i>English training:</i><br>
	</b>Intensive training in written and conversational English, including 
	presentation skills 
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Final year projects:</i><br>
	</b>One year project in an area of specialization under the guidance of 
	faculty advisors&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Student tutors:</i><br>
	</b>Second and third year student helpers providing help to students in 
	first-year courses </li>
</ul>
<p>&#12288;</p>
<h3>Our Graduates</h3>
<p>About 20% of our graduates choose to pursue postgraduate study immediately 
after graduation. While many of them stayed in HKUST for MPhil (Master of 
Philosophy) study, some went abroad to study at top universities, including 
Stanford University, University of Southern California, University of Toronto, 
University of Texas at Austin, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who choose to work found excellent jobs. While graduates from related 
disciplines also look for computing related jobs, Computer Science graduates 
clearly have great advantages after completing a comprehensive program that 
provides solid training in fundamentals and many emerging areas of IT and 
computing.</p>
