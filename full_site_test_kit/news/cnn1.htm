<h1>Sauerkraut Capital is sweet on accordions</h1>
<p><b>WISHEK, North Dakota</b> (AP) -- A few miles off the Lawrence Welk Highway 
is a community where the sound of &quot;O Du Lieber Augustin&quot; is as common as 
anything by Britney Spears, Jay-Z or Garth Brooks.</p>
<p>Wishek calls itself the &quot;Sauerkraut Capital of the World&quot; and German is 
almost as common as English. High school music teacher Janet Wolff isn't afraid 
to teach the accordion.</p>
<p>Her teenage students don't balk at picking up the instrument or performing in 
an auditorium full of old-timers who take their German traditions seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just something different,&quot; said 17-year-old Kasandra Huber. &quot;I thought 
it would be fun. And it is fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Wishek High School has 110 students. Huber is one of seven who play the 
accordion, an instrument made famous by Welk, who died in 1992, and the late 
Myron Floren, who both entertained generations of TV viewers on &quot;The Lawrence 
Welk Show.&quot;</p>
<p>In Wishek, a town of about 1,100 people, the accordion players include Jason 
Hochhalter, 18, a muscular high school senior, and Christy Schaffer, 15, a 
petite, full-blooded German who has been practicing for four years.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was younger, I thought it was something different to do,&quot; Schaffer 
said. &quot;My grandpa did it. And I thought it would be interesting to play 
something different, that no other kid was playing.&quot;</p>
<p>Wolff, who grew up in the Minneapolis area, married a German with accordions 
after taking the teaching job in Wishek in 1988. She thought the accordion would 
be perfect for performances during Sauerkraut Day, an annual sauerkraut and 
sausage festival held in Wishek for eight decades.</p>
<p>Wolff started teaching the accordion four years ago, using instruments 
borrowed from people in town. &quot;It's just another instrument to be exposed to,&quot; 
she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just going to play it for a day, and then I ended up keeping it,&quot; said 
Hochhalter, who looks like he would be more at home in a weight-lifting room 
than a music room.</p>
<p>When other students chimed in and good-naturedly chided him for &quot;stealing&quot; 
the accordion from another student, he grinned and added, &quot;They're just 
jealous.&quot;</p>
<h3>'Wunnerful, wunnerful'</h3>
<p>The culture of the farming region also helps, Wolff said. Welk, the 
bandleader whose &quot;wunnerful, wunnerful&quot; show of the 1950s and 1960s can still be 
seen in public television reruns, grew up in nearby Strasburg. Many older 
residents converse in German, and wedding dances still feature polkas and 
waltzes, Wolff said.</p>
<p>Lisa Horner, 17, said the student accordion players are following in their 
grandparents' footsteps. &quot;It's kind of cool,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The students like modern-day music but all know Lawrence Welk. &quot;My dad 
watched all the time,&quot; Horner said. &quot;He was like, 'We've got to watch Lawrence 
Welk.&quot;'</p>
<p>Helmi Harrington, who runs music studios in the Minneapolis suburb of 
Burnsville and in Superior, Wisconsin, is the director of A World of Accordions 
Museum in Duluth, Minnesota. She is not surprised to hear that teenagers in 
North Dakota play the accordion.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1990s there was a trend toward nostalgia, toward finding our roots in 
America,&quot; she said. &quot;That always brings people back to ethnic connectors.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrington, who has played the accordion for more than half a century, said 
the instrument is unique in that it creates melody, harmony and rhythm like a 
piano or organ, but is more portable.</p>
<p>&quot;A single person can shine in a spotlight with marvelous notes,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>However, with its keyboard, pushbuttons and bellows, &quot;it is a very difficult 
instrument to play well,&quot; Harrington said.</p>
<p>Wolff said she cannot envision teaching the accordion in a big city like 
Minneapolis, but has never had a student in Wishek refuse to try it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of our heritage,&quot; Huber said.</p>
