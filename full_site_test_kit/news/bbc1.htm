<h1>Fifth nest for rare birds project</h1>
<p><b>A project to introduce a rare bird of prey back into the skies of 
north-east England has been more successful than first thought.</b></p>
<p>The Northern Kites scheme was started in 2004 to restore a breeding 
population of Red Kites to the region. <br>
<br>
Since then 94 of the birds have been released into Gateshead's Derwent Valley 
and four pairs nested in the area in 2006, raising three chicks. <br>
<br>
A fifth nest, with two chicks, has now been discovered in Teesdale. <br>
<br>
David Hirst, of the RSPB, said: &quot;The news of our Northern Kites just gets better 
and better. <br>
<br>
&quot;We were very pleased that one chick had successfully flown from the Derwent 
Valley nest, but now we know that we actually had five nests and three young 
'home-grown' red kites this year and that's just fantastic news. <br>
<br>
&quot;No-one expected the project to be so successful in such a short space of time.&quot;
<br>
<br>
It is hoped that more kites will nest successfully next year and the population 
will soon become self-sustaining. <br>
<br>
The birds were formerly widespread and common in the UK, but human persecution 
led to their extinction in England and Scotland in the mid to late-1800s. <br>
<br>
Colonies now exist in the Rockingham Forest area of the Midlands, in central 
Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway. <br>
