<h1>West Ham 2-1 Blackburn</h1>
<p><b>Goals from Teddy Sheringham and Hayden Mullins lifted West Ham out of the 
Premiership relegation zone to ease the pressure on boss Alan Pardew.</b></p>
<p>Sheringham rose superbly to guide home a header after Yossi Benayoun crossed 
on 21 minutes - the first time he had scored since turning 40 in April. <br>
<br>
With 10 minutes left, Mullins got a foot to Matthew Etherington's corner to 
thump the ball past Brad Friedel. <br>
<br>
Late on David Bentley struck to capitalise on a Robert Green error<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>West Ham turned in a mixed performance - vibrant in patches but riddled with 
nerves, which was perhaps understandable given their precarious league position 
after a horrendous run that has led to them losing eight successive games.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes' side found it hard to get behind the West Ham defence and it was 
not until the 73rd minute that Green had to make his first serious save when he 
spooned away the ball after Lucas Neill's instinctive shot. <br>
<br>
The visitors might point to the loss of Jason Roberts, who was carried off to be 
replaced by Francis Jeffers on the half-hour, as a mitigating factor in their 
defeat. <br>
<br>
However, having drawn at Liverpool a fortnight ago, Blackburn have now lost two 
league games in a row. <br>
<br>
It took a good 15 minutes for West Ham to find any rhythm and when they did, 
Pardew's side began to trouble Blackburn on the wings. <br>
<br>
Freed by Sheringham's clever flick, Matthew Etherington over-hit his cross, with 
Blackburn's defence in retreat. <br>
<br>
A second cross - this time from the other flank delivered by Bobby Zamora - drew 
a one-handed save from Brad Friedel but there was no West Ham player following 
up. <br>
<br>
A third cross resulted in West Ham's opener as Sheringham rolled back the years 
with an angled header. <br>
<br>
Benayoun teed up the cross like a golfer chipping from a bunker and Sheringham 
rose to power a header into Friedel's top left-hand corner. <br>
<br>
It was West Ham's first goal in over eight hours of football and the first time 
Sheringham had scored since March. <br>
<br>
When he was substituted in the 77th minute, Sheringham received a huge ovation 
from the Upton Park crowd. <br>
<br>
The second half drew a more spirited performance from Blackburn and, with more 
fortune Neill, might have equalised but his shot went straight to Green. <br>
<br>
West Ham immediately broke and Friedel did well to stop Bobby Zamora scoring.
<br>
<br>
But West Ham did not have to wait long for their second goal, Mullins throwing 
himself at the ball as Etherington swung in a dangerous corner. <br>
<br>
Blackburn pulled a goal back in the second minute of stoppage time when Bentley 
reacted quickly to punish Green for his failure to hold Benni McCarthy's low 
shot. <br>
<br>
Bentley's goal ensured it was a tense final two minutes and Francis Jeffers 
almost snatched an equaliser with a looping header. <br>
