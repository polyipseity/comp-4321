<h1>MP urges BT Goonhilly commitment</h1>
<p><b>A Cornish MP is urging BT to continue its commitment to the Goonhilly 
Earth Satellite Station on the Lizard.</b></p>
<p>Lib Dem MP Andrew George wants the site to contribute to the economic 
generation of the area by making the facilities available to local firms. <br>
<br>
Goonhilly has nearly 3,000sq metres of accommodation to rent and further 
buildings available for storage. <br>
<br>
In September, BT announced plans to scale down its operations at the site - 
possibly making 90 staff redundant. <br>
<br>
An internal BT report says the move to its Madeley site in Herefordshire would 
help the firm centralise and remain competitive. <br>
<br>
&quot;Naturally, I would prefer it if BT reversed its proposal to withdraw jobs from 
Goonhilly and to build up their operations on this historically important site, 
thus benefiting the economy of a significantly poorer region than the one they 
will now concentrate on,&quot; said Mr George. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have made it clear to BT that although I object to their decision to move 
jobs from Cornwall, I am prepared to work with them to ensure the economic and 
job creation potential of the site is maximised for the benefit of West 
Cornwall.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mr George said many companies could benefit from the equipment at the site, 
including the university. <br>
<br>
His comments were made after a meeting with BT's regional manager, Lizzey 
Beesley, and the Goonhilly director of technology and surfaces Des Prouse. <br>
<br>
Goonhilly currently handles about 10 million telephone calls a week as well as 
computer data from the Atlantic and Indian Ocean areas, but its TV operations 
have been wound down over the years. <br>
<br>
A decision is expected to be confirmed by BT executives later this year, with 
satellite communications ending by 2008. <br>
