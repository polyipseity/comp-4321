It deals<br>with some highly unusual people living in some highly unusual houses.<br>After a quick round-robin visit to each house and occupants, that lasts<br>about ten minutes, we know about as much about these people and their<br>houses as we find out in the next hour. We are left with wanting to<br>know more about how these people came to be in their current situations<br>and about the history of their houses. For example, the alligator man<br>says that everything in his house has a sentimental value - then show<br>us some of those things and explain to us what they mean to him.I wanted to see more about the houses themselves - how they are laid<br>out and how the people live in them. The people who live in the old<br>missile silo give us a ten second tour of where the rooms are in their<br>house *from above ground,* and that is it for the overview.These people are satisfying some deep emotions through their living<br>environments and I wanted to know more. Think what Errol Morris would<br>have done with this material.The film indeed has the look of a home movie, so the title is a clever<br>pun.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Home Movie (2001)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>the mannequin guy<br>lunabean1978<br>This was not originally a movie...<br>felixblackcat<br> was this shown anywhere<br>majaco<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Live and Let Die<br>The Aviator<br>Joe Dirt<br>The Lake House<br>Strange Planet<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
