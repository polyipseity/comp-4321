In addition to the inside-joke casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, there are several other allusions to Jane Austen's story: Mark disparages Bridget to his mother within earshot of Bridget. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy disparages Elizabeth to his friend Mr. Bingley within earshot of Elizabeth. Daniel Cleaver lies to Bridget about a dispute between him and Mark, claiming Mark stole his fianc&#233;e; in fact, it was the other way around. In Pride and Prejudice, it's a dispute between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy, and Wickham lies about who's at fault. The Darcy in both stories fails to disabuse the heroine's misinformed notion until it's almost too late. Bridget works at Pemberley Press; Mr. Darcy lives at Pemberley estate. Crispin Bonham-Carter was in both productions (his scenes were cut out of Bridget Jones's Diary, although he can still be seen in the job-quitting scene and can also be seen at the Kafka book launch where Bridget asks Salman Rushdie where the toilets are - he is seen as the man on the left in the conversation.).<br>more<br>Goofs:<br>Continuity: When we first see Bridget writing in her diary, listing the type of person she's not going to get involved with (with narration), she is writing on the left-hand page. In the next shot, she is at the bottom of the right-hand page.<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>Bridget:<br>The only thing worse than smug married couple; lots of smug married couples.<br>more<br>Movie Connections:<br>Spoofed in &#34;Torchwood: Greeks Bearing Gifts (#1.7)&#34; (2006)<br>more<br>Soundtrack:<br>ME AND MRS JONES<br>more<br>This FAQ is empty.

It sure seemed familiar and lo and behold then I read<br>about the Pride and Prejudice connection and then it all made complete<br>sense.This is such a charming, lovely homage to Pride and Prejudice. The<br>three lead characters are just perfect. It is funny, sweet at times,<br>sad at others, and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic (especially<br>the last 1/4th of it).Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones, who would have ever thought<br>she could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent<br>seems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario<br>throughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His<br>ability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over<br>by the end of the movie is sublime.I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts<br>forth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his<br>facial expressions. While Daniel (Mr. Grant's character) chatters on<br>and on and tries to charm with his wit and words, Mark Darcy (Mr.<br>Firth's character) just has a strong and rather silent presence along<br>with an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over (as<br>well as Bridget).This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well.<br>Contemporary events, gender inequities, social differences, work place<br>decorum, fashion, self-image, sex, family, and friendship all come<br>under the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone, scene<br>selection, dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of<br>the book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Colin Firth or Hugh Grant?<br>nikki16<br>Do you think single women are portrayed realistically through BJ?<br>skdabrowski<br>Fight Scene<br>kambo63<br>Bridget Jones was not overweight<br>aupied2002<br>Bridget's Accent<br>suedepatch<br>The final scene-- kissing<br>WoHoW<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason<br>Love Actually<br>On Her Majesty's Secret Service<br>Peyton Place<br>Strange Planet<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
