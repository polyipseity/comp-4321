This 2nd sequel<br>to the original and quite good &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; stinks<br>everywhere. The story is lame and the characters have been reduced to<br>caricatures of themselves.Let&#39;s start with the story. The premise here is that those Enos boys<br>are at it again, wanting to have some fun at the expense of someone.<br>That someone is none other than Sheriff Buford T. Justice (insert<br>Jackie Gleason&#39;s distinct, Southern lispy drawl) who has just put in<br>for retirement. When those retirement plans aren&#39;t what they originally<br>seemed, our valiant Sheriff accepts the Enos&#39; challenge: Deliver a<br>plastic shark to the new restaurant the Enos boys opened up. While<br>along the way, those rascally Enos dudes are going to try to stop him<br>at any cost.Okay, stop right there. In the first Bandit movie, the idea was a<br>simple challenge and bet. The Enos boys were depicted as nothing more<br>than a rich father and son team who were bored so they thought up a<br>good challenge. No real maliciousness involved - just a challenge with<br>some money put up to make people take it seriously. That was fun.In the 2nd Bandit movie, the Enos reputation (such as it is) is on the<br>line and they want to beat a political rival. Not as strong, but again,<br>nothing terribly malicious involved. This movie has them just trying to be mean to their new play toy.<br>Namely, Sheriff Justice. So they send him on his way and start trying<br>to sabotage his trip. When Justice beats them at every turn, they<br>figure that they need a professional to deal with him. Since the Bandit<br>isn&#39;t around (he&#39;s off making &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;) they give the job (and the<br>red shirt, belt buckle and hat) to Cledus, our old truck driving buddy.So, Cledus chases Justice to get the prized shark and fun and laughter<br>ensue. Well, not too much fun and little laughter but look on the<br>bright side - it was a paycheck for Gleason and Reed. Anyway, from there on out it becomes the now tired old cat-and-mouse<br>game with one side giving chase to the other. But even the chases lack<br>the polish to make you remember back to the ones in the 1977 original.<br>They seem more staged and one dimensional. For example, there&#39;s a scene<br>where Cledus and a new buddy &quot;sneak&quot; up from behind and take the shark<br>off of the Sheriff&#39;s car. The shot is not technically difficult and<br>it&#39;s rather boring. Plus, what law enforcement officer doesn&#39;t check<br>his mirror to make sure of what&#39;s behind him? I learned that in 11th<br>grade driver&#39;s ed.Anway, to summarize, I think the use of the 1982 (anemic) Trans Am is<br>allegorical to the rest of the cast: It&#39;s got the right name but is<br>under-thought, underpowered and basically is just a diluted version of<br>its former self.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>funny movie<br>mrolympia_123<br>Gator Kicks<br>rolykeates<br>The sand Plant<br>rolykeates<br>Did anyone here see the original version.<br>MasterPain_2<br>Editing<br>ID already taken<br>anyone else notice..<br>jnoble11<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Smokey and the Bandit II<br>Smokey and the Bandit<br>The Cannonball Run<br>Thelma &#38; Louise<br>Speed Zone!<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
