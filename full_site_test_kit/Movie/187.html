But as i work in blockbusters, i<br>get free rentals every week so thought i might as well rent it out.<br>Man, was i in for a shocker!! Talk about totally hilarious.Some of the gags in this film were quality - Robin Williams is at his<br>comical best. I'm not saying it's Williams' best ever film (cough good<br>will hunting cough) but certainly he's never been this funny. His gag<br>about the abnormally shaped cookie was so funny. In fact, i've never<br>laughed this much since Dumb and Dumber.Edward Norton was actually very believable as the clean cut good guy. I<br>didn't expect it from him after watching Fight club and American<br>history X but he carried out his role really well.Catherine Keener also looked really beautiful, she played her<br>power-hungry turned nice chick character to a tee.Even though the story is about a kids show, there's a lot of dark<br>comedy in it e.g. the involvement of the Irish gangsters (by the way<br>also very funny) showing what a good job Danny devito has done<br>directing this film. Credit to him. All the characters in the film<br>served a purpose and above all, did it well!! All seemed believable and<br>Robin Williams was the star.If you watch this film, persevere for the first 20 minutes because<br>after which the jokes and plot come in hard and thick.Top stuff, rent if you want a comedy with original storyline and a<br>little bit of good humoured smut thrown in for good measure.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Death to Smoochy (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME<br>wolver12345<br>Yahoogroups new Edward Norton group!<br>IamTammyP<br>'Hard Times for Haggis?'
