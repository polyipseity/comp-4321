Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Virtuoso performance, 21 April 2002<br>Author:<br>Duncan Gowers from London, United Kingdom<br>&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is essentially a film of a concert, yet thanks<br>to the drug and ego-addled personalities of Led Zeppelin in the mid-1970s,<br>the footage is fleshed out to include weird 'fantasy' sequences involving<br>each of the four band members.While this section of the movie leaves a<br>little to be desired, the concert footage is truly breathtaking, capturing<br>the greatest hard rock band in history at their apogee.The film opens with an odd gangster-style sequence, where faceless mobsters<br>are mowed down by what would appear to be rival gangsters.Whatever meaning<br>this scene is meant to represent is not clear, however it has been suggested<br>that the faceless mobsters are the British press, who had vilified Led<br>Zeppelin through their entire career.Who knows, but it certainly makes for<br>an interesting start to the film.From there the film takes an interesting turn.Each individual band member<br>is introduced.We see drummer John Bonham ploughing his fields in a<br>tractor, bassist John Paul Jones reading nursery rhymes to his children,<br>singer Robert Plant playing with his wife and children in an English country<br>lake (the scene resembles the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1973 album 'Houses of<br>the Holy'), while guitarist Jimmy Page is introduced next to a riverside.<br>They each receive a letter informing them that they are to tour the next<br>day.Once Led Zeppelin take the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden, the<br>action really begins.The band run through some of their absolute classics,<br>including 'Whole Lotta Love', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Heartbreaker' and a<br>massive version of 'Dazed and Confused'.The quality of musicianship is<br>amazing.Page's guitar playing belies belief and John Bonham's twenty<br>minute drum solo is awe inspiring.As the band plays there are more fantasy<br>scenes, the best of which includes Robert Plant as some kind of Arthurian<br>hero.The way in which Led Zeppelin embrace and play on the Tolkien-like<br>world of mystical fantasy is truly refreshing in these over-stylised days,<br>where musicians are more concerned with the amount of gel in their hair than<br>the music they produce.Watching the band at work you get a distinct feeling that the musicians of<br>today really aren't as proficient as they were twenty or thirty years ago.<br>Led Zeppelin it seems were better live than on record, which would be<br>unheard of today.As an audience we are able to see &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; for what it<br>is: a timepiece.Post-1975, Led Zeppelin's work became gradually lower in<br>quality and as Punk revolutionised the music scene, they became dinosaurs at<br>the end of the decade.But in this time, their 1971-1975 period, Led<br>Zeppelin were the biggest band in the world, and their power is captured<br>with brilliant clarity on this film.Whatever happened after this time is a<br>moot point; this is how Led Zeppelin should and will be remembered.A must<br>for any serious music fan.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Song Remains the Same (1976)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Fave Zep Song!!!!!
