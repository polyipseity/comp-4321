Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>6 out of 6 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Power at his most charming., 23 June 1999<br>Author:<br>David Atfield (bits@alphalink.com.au) from Canberra, Australia<br>Tyrone Power is so charismatic in this film that the rest of it hardly<br>matters.His astonishing good looks and easy charm really make this film.<br>But there is also good direction, a witty script, great Oscar-winning<br>special effects and fine cinematography.Betty Grable has never done much for me, but she's pleasant enough in<br>this.<br>But the aerial work, done mostly with models, is exceptionally strong<br>particularly in a spectacular and believable recreation of the evacuation<br>at<br>Dunkirk.This is a war propaganda film, designed to encourage the USA to<br>join the war in Europe - but it is not cloyingly over patriotic.And<br>there<br>are some very original moments - look at the scene where Power wakes up<br>and<br>doesn't know where he is.The camera stays in extreme close-up on his<br>face<br>for a long time, so we don't know where he is either.We see him go<br>through<br>fear and bewilderment as we hear strange sounds.Finally his face relaxes<br>and the camera pulls back to reveal...well I don't want to spoil it for<br>you,<br>but this is a very strong directorial decision.Henry King is to be<br>praised.You'll enjoy this film.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for A Yank in the R.A.F.
