An unusual film, at least for its time. A<br>stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music.<br>The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating<br>a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told.<br>The pace is perfect. I wasn&#39;t bored for a second, nor did I ever really<br>want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent,<br>and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget,<br>the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting<br>is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this<br>is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel,<br>Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well,<br>let&#39;s be honest, it had rather awful acting. I&#39;m speaking, of course,<br>of Tarantino&#39;s character. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong; in From Dusk Till<br>Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I&#39;ve seen him<br>act, he just doesn&#39;t seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker<br>myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can<br>relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just<br>need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can&#39;t act. Still,<br>that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least<br>two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely<br>expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very<br>easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won&#39;t<br>name them here, but anyone who&#39;s seen the film will know who I&#39;m<br>talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their<br>actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing...<br>something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat<br>drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes<br>to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very<br>well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line<br>telling the story far better than a &quot;regular&quot; film ever could. One of<br>the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked<br>me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone<br>editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc.<br>- so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I&#39;m sorry, I entirely<br>respect their right to do such a thing... and I won&#39;t claim that their<br>doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way...<br>but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies<br>in the time-line. Also, I&#39;m a firm believer of watching something the<br>way the makers intended it. Don&#39;t edit, don&#39;t censor, don&#39;t make your<br>own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own<br>version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need<br>to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great.<br>Tarantino collected so many amazing 70&#39;s tunes for this film and used<br>them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little<br>keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I&#39;ve covered here. I<br>recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes<br>their films with a side of style. 8/10<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Reservoir Dogs (1992)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Alternate themes?<br>Shepherd_Soccer<br>Opening scene<br>jmmycsnv<br>The balloon SPOILER<br>Steve_Kaczynski<br>White whispers something to Orange?<br>donmichaelK<br>Question (Spoilers)<br>elmexicano508<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Pulp Fiction<br>The Departed<br>Cidade de Deus<br>Scarface<br>Kill Bill: Vol. 1<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
