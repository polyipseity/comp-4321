Steve Burrows is more committed to the art of<br>funny than anyone I've ever met. His timing is impeccable, his<br>performance is charming, his writing is off-beat, and he's not a<br>pretty boy (at all). I've had the pleasure of working with Steve<br>recently, and this movie is one of the reasons why I even wanted<br>to. See it as soon as it's released (last Iheard was later this<br>year).Whoever gave this film a BAD review has no sense of humor. You<br>can't deny funny when it's there. And funny is all over this flick.Okay, nuff said. See the film. Even if it's just because Steve's a nice<br>guy. Which he really is.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chump Change (2001)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Did Dan Fante write this?<br>wawwazat<br>im sorry, but i hated this movie<br>moonlight_graham1922<br>EVERYBODY SAY RAMOOOOOONE!<br>Solver_Revolver<br>Tim Matheson is FUNNY<br>gareth-36<br>Movie is great -- but rating system(starred) is whack<br>RJ-15<br>Release Chump Change, Please!!!<br>hondousa<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Sunset Blvd.<br>The Player<br>Lost in Translation<br>Swimming with Sharks<br>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
