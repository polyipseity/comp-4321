Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>4 out of 6 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Wong Jing take on Sex and the City, 5 June 2004<br>Author:<br>goodmen from Canada<br>The Wong Jing direct, produce and write is back with his version of the<br>popular HBO series, 'Sex and the City'. The stars power in this movie<br>is great, we have Carina Lau has Selina the lead actress who is a<br>psychoanalyst, who hang out with her friends (Athena Chu has a erotic<br>story for woman, Yoyo Mung has a multi-restaurant owner who like the<br>danger side, and Pinky Cheung whose dad is a triad boss goes retirement<br>and know how to fight). The story begin when Selina ex came to her and<br>ask her to take care of her wild daughter (Cecilia Cheung in another<br>bizarre look) and tried to cure her wild behaviour. Well the rest of<br>the storyline consist of the 4 woman and there relationship with the<br>guys, we have Tony Leung Ka Fai going after Carina Lau, Athena Chu<br>going after Edisen Chen, Picky Cheung going after Andy Hui, and Lu Yi<br>going after Yoyo Mung. The movie was mildly entertaining and the stars in this movie were fun<br>to watch, but the flow and situation of the story do get tiring. Andy<br>Hui look hot with his bodyguard suit and his non facial expression.<br>Some of the stuff in this movie is just a recycle from other movies<br>(Analysis This for one), which make the movie rather less enjoyable.<br>The narrative talk from Carina was excitement giving us enough<br>information on her friends and fine performance from everyone except<br>Edisen Chen (I don't hate this fellow Canadian). This movie lack new<br>idea, and the comedy is not that funny, I can't really compare to the<br>HBO series because I never watched it.If you are fans of any of these stars I recommend watching this because<br>the movie wasn't boring at all. Don't expect the movie to be some<br>clever script or anything special.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sing gam diy shut (2004)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Ching mai daai wa wong<br>Jing gu jyun ga<br>Yu long gong wu<br>Cheng chong chui lui chai<br>Sing si lip yan<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
