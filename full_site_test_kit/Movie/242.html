The second half of the film builds upon the script to create an ending concurrent to the one shown in the TV series.<br>more<br>Goofs:<br>Plot holes: In the battle scene with the mass production EVAs, Asuka has destroyed all but one EVA, which she is in the process of defeating - just as one of the false Lances of Longinus is thrown at her, which she turns to repel, unsuccessfully, with her AT field. With all the other MP EVAs out of commission - and none of them 'waking up' or 'coming back to life' until after Asuka's power runs out - there should have been no-one to throw the Lance at her.<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>Asuka Langley Sohryuu:<br>I'll-kill-you-I'll-kill-you-I'll-kill-you- I'll-kill-you-I'll-kil - - [Asuka's upraised arm splits in half as EVA-02's arm is split by a Lance of Longinus]<br>more<br>Movie Connections:<br>Edited from &#34;Shin seiki evangelion: The Beginning and the End, or 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' (#1.24)&#34; (1996)<br>more<br>Soundtrack:<br>Tanin no Kanshou<br>more<br>This FAQ is empty. Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>this is the end, 11 May 2005<br>Author:<br>neon47 from United States<br>A precaution one might want to take before viewing this is: if one<br>HASN'T seen the series they are NOT going to get this. And even if one<br>has seen the series they still might not get all of this, but that's<br>the beauty of Anno's masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of<br>Evangelion. This alternate ending to the series was released after fans<br>complained about the series original ending. If you've seen the<br>original ending you already know that the actual &quot;ending&quot; analyzes the<br>characters Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Misato. While episode 26 of the<br>original series is a complete fixation on Shinji, everything that<br>happens in that episode still happens to him in the last part of this.<br>Only his decision reverses. This shows a much more dramatic and<br>extended version of Episodes 25 and 26 however, and answers a lot of<br>the questions that were left at the end of the series and does a great<br>job generating new ones. If you're a fan of the original series then<br>this is a must see because it's way better than the original ending.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Shin seiki Evangelion Gekij&#244;-ban: Air/Magokoro wo, kimi ni (1997)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Shinji is a sick bastard.<br>nutman-2<br>Shinji strangels Auska, is it a dream?<br>krishneelz<br>The Third Impact - Help!!!<br>Rei_Lilith<br>I hope they don't change Shinji.<br>golmicha<br>Most disturbing scene?<br>alfredlim<br>More detail on how the EVAs were created?<br>darkshadowcobra<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Akira<br>Koroshiya 1<br>American Beauty<br>Kill Bill: Vol. 1<br>Izo<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
