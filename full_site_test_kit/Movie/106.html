These are without doubt the best live<br>performances i have ever seen. The first concert was Stevie Ray&#39;s first<br>appearance at the Montreux jazz were the crowd showered him in boo&#39;s<br>and hisses. Even though the crowd didn&#39;t think so the concert was<br>amazing and proved to be one of his most important concerts. The second<br>concert was even better. The crowd were now familiar with Stevies music<br>and greeted him with the respect and reception that he deserved. If you<br>are a fan of guitar music, blues or rock then you will love the unique<br>style of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Its just a pity that he died so soon. His<br>music will live on forever.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble: Live at Montreux 1982 &#38; 1985 (2004) (V)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>I Wanna Be a Republican<br>Concert for George<br>Rush in Rio<br>Bruce Springsteen &#38; the E Street Band<br>Fearless Freaks<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
