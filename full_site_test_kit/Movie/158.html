Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Not THAT bad, 31 July 2006<br>Author:<br>MissTRious from m/s Seven Seas Mariner<br>So before I start this comment a couple of pieces of information....<br>Firstly, I am a Ben Browder fan so not only saw but purchased this film<br>for this reason and secondly, even before I clicked the purchase button<br>on Amazon I read the comments already listed on this site.I would like to say that although it would never win any Oscars, on the<br>whole this was not that bad a film.C. Thomas Howell, one of my favourite 80&#39;s stars, does not look good in<br>this movie I have to admit. At times he looked more like a strangulated<br>Jim Carrey doing one of his goofy faces. His acting was not the best I<br>have to admit, although I have to say in his defence that the story was<br>quite preposterous at points (especially the whole idea of him just<br>jumping in his BMW and tootling down to the wrong side of the tracks to<br>find out answers!)Sean Young is of very little consequence really. Aside from looking<br>good (and naked for about .05 of a second) she is ignored on the whole.DeeDee Pfeiffer&#39;s role could have been expanded but as it is was left<br>pretty two dimensional.As for Ben Browder, his was actually quite a pivotal role and aided the<br>story twists, but again was under utilised.I have to say the worst culprit of the whole movie was the story. It<br>was very slow in places dragging its feet over unnecessary elements and<br>then suddenly making great leaps across other plot features. However, even though it was no &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; (the only film in<br>creation to keep me guessing until the last second, no mean feat I can<br>tell you) it had some nice twists and the ending was explained well (I<br>hate half-endings).Overall, if I saw this coming on TV I would watch it again, and I feel<br>that I have made a worthwhile (if a little frivolous) purchase from<br>Amazon.My final two thoughts are:Firstly, re: the extras on the DVD, DON&#39;T bother with the deleted<br>scenes and DO listen to what Brad and Ben say in their interview! They<br>tell you NOT to watch the interview before the movie as they give away<br>a MAJOR plot feature (I did not heed their advice and so fell foul of<br>this fact!)and secondly, it is so strange to hear Ben swear. Never could quite get<br>used to it :-)<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for A Killer Within (2004)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Worst movie Ever<br>chivas480<br>Interpreting 2 sentences<br>PiranianRose<br>****spoiler*** Dr Pepper<br>roger565<br>whos that girl durin the vargas interrogation scene??<br>maximuz20032003<br>The magnets<br>biohazard12589<br>Anyone Know Anything About this Movie?<br>thehistorymajor<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Entre las piernas<br>In Pursuit<br>Pretty Persuasion<br>Sacrifice<br>Affliction<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
