The great soundtrack's now been out on CD for a few years; the theme was<br>produced by the Pet Shop Boys and sung by authentic 60's icon Dusty<br>Springfield.All other songs chosen charted during the early 60's, giving<br>the film the ring of authenticity.And due possibly to legal problems, the<br>original performance of Chubby Checker's THE TWIST couldn't be used, so<br>Checker re-recorded it for this film.This newer, punchy 1989 version is<br>the one used today behind Pantene shampoo commercials.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Scandal (1989)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Bridget Fonda with a British accent<br>XenaUK<br>One of the best films ever and a missing scene<br>dani_mckinley<br>Available on DVD?<br>debyhelen<br>She wears a red ribbon and a huli huli skirt...<br>devilsmercy03<br>U.K Dvd???<br>powderblue<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Draughtsman's Contract<br>Lady Caroline Lamb<br>Let Him Have It<br>Nineteen Eighty-Four<br>The Last September<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
