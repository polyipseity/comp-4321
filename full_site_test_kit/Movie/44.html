Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Very Good Story, 22 August 2005<br>Author:<br>bob-rutzel from United States<br>A young woman, Percy (Elliott), is released from prison and goes to a<br>small town in Maine to start over. She gets a job at the Spitfire Grill<br>run by Hannah (Burstyn). Starting over in a small New England town with<br>its clannish ways and suspicions of strangers is not easy and Percy has<br>a hard row to hoe.A friend of mine said they don't make movies like this anymore and he<br>is right. The owner of the Prime Time Video store says this movie is<br>always going out the door and did surmise that it might be a cult<br>movie. He has not seen it yet. Well, it's not a cult movie. It's simply<br>a very good story.It's a wonderful true to life story about three women (Gay Harden being<br>the other one) who carry their baggage with them and try to get by.<br>Percy is haunted by her past; Hannah is guilt-ridden regarding her<br>family; and Shelby (Gay Harden) is tormented by her husband. All three<br>need each other to understand each is not alone.I went back to 1996 and 1997 to see if this movie or stars had been<br>nominated for anything in the Academy Awards. Nothing was found, but<br>there should have been something or someone nominated. I would have<br>guessed that Marcia Gay Harden would have been nominated for a best<br>supporting actress award. She would have had my vote.Although made in 1996, I suppose this is the type of movie that goes<br>out the door a lot because of word of mouth. If you see this movie,<br>pass it on. It is a very good story.BTW: the friend who recommended this to me owes me a box of Kleenix.<br>Yeah, you're gonna need it.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Spitfire Grill (1996)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>The ending?<br>Destinygirlk-1<br>Who was Eli?<br>ashputtle<br>lyrics-mini spoiler<br>mildlypsychotic<br>Hannah's safe at the Spitfire Grill<br>thorsail<br>Percy Christ?<br>sjberke<br>Clare, the Contest Winner<br>petsisme<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>A Map of the World<br>Peyton Place<br>A Child Is Missing<br>Infamous<br>Ek Hasina Thi<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
