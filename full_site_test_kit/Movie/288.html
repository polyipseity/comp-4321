Only Jim Carrey's work on &quot;In Living Color&quot;<br>surpasses him. Like Carrey, Kattan is the kind of comedian that you<br>either love or hate. Or you might love him at first but eventually<br>he'll get on your nerves. Kattan also has this gay stigma hanging over<br>his head, hindering a successful movie career like Carrey and<br>Groundlings pal Will Ferrell. At least for now. This compilation opens<br>with the first appearance of the Roxbury Guys, when Will and Chris were<br>just trying out the idea and had not even found Haddaway's 'What is<br>Love' to head-bop to. This made me expect some more Roxbury dancing<br>later on in the show, but no such luck.His many recurring characters appear one by one, including one of the<br>most elaborate Mango skits they ever did (Mango vs. J-lo), Suel<br>Forrester in court, the Zimmermans at Halloween (Chris and Cheri Oteri<br>are a great match) and that other pair of dancing brothers, the<br>DeMarco's, auditioning for Bon Jovi. For some reason Jovi seems to drag<br>out the ending long past the stage of being funny. When it comes to his<br>most energetic and far out character of all, I would not have picked<br>the Mr. Peepers skit with Kevin Spacey as the best one. The ones with<br>The Rock and Tom Hanks were much funnier. Besides, I think they edited<br>it somewhat. My absolute favourite in this collection has to be the<br>'How do you say? Ah Yes! Show' with Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Love<br>Hewitt.During a montage of celebrity impressions it becomes clear Kattan is<br>not the best mimic on the show, but his take on Pacino is absolutely<br>hilarious. The White trash couple is pretty disgusting, especially when<br>Amy Poehlerwants to suck his toe-thumb (don't ask). As usual Fred<br>Armisen steals the show in the Buddy Mills sketch, and when they get to<br>Goth Talk, it's the one where his character Azrael Abbys is pretending<br>to be dead. Well I guess he was always more of a sidekick in that one<br>anyway. There are three clips from Weekend update, one with Norm and<br>two with Jimmy and Tina. Kattan's first appearance as Gollum is<br>actually taken from the Superbowl Half-time show. It ends with the<br>Siamese twins skit with Jennifer Garner that has Chris playing a<br>normal, boring straight guy. I guess they had to reinforce that image<br>one last time. Either that or it was an excuse to have more Jimmy<br>Fallon in there. They should have put in another round of Roxbury if<br>you ask me.9 out of 10<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Saturday Night Live: The Best of Chris Kattan (2003) (TV)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>A Bug's Life<br>Meet the Parents<br>Keeping the Faith<br>The Opposite of Sex<br>The Big Kahuna<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
