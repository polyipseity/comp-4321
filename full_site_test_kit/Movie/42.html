For a young director, Ms. Paci, shows a lot of talent in<br>the way she has constructed the film and in the performances she gets<br>from her actors.The film presents the story of Gilda, a young woman getting over the<br>death of her father. At the same time, it's revealed, accidentally, her<br>father might have been involved with another woman. Her reaction is not<br>typical, as she decides to go away to her grandparents in New York as a<br>way to rebel against her mother.

Laila Robins, an extraordinary actress<br>who works in the New York theatre extensively, brings an intelligent<br>approach to Gilda's mother, who has also been betrayed by her husband.<br>Mary Louise Wilson and Josef Sommer make brief appearances as Gilda's<br>grandparents. Also, Michele Placido is seen as Giorgio.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Searching for Paradise (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>I f you could get a celeb to take you to their hotel room who?<br>magicpowers<br>where????<br>swxt_avenged7x<br>Please tell me someone else saw this<br>potblackettle<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Menace II Society<br>The Mighty<br>Edge<br>Nebraska<br>Donnie Darko<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
