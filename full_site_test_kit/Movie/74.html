At<br>first, she's just a pawn in a situation that she wasn't supposed to be<br>a part of, but as each person gets killed coming after the money, she<br>becomes the aggressor and wants to keep the money badly so that she can<br>start life anew in another country. This movie is thrilling,<br>exhilarating, comic, tragic, frightening and full of twists and turns.<br>The woman in the middle of everything is played superbly by Lalita<br>Panyopas as she gets deeper and deeper into her situation and becomes<br>more and more hardlined. As she cleans the blood from her apartment<br>after each killing she breaks down only once, and then gives into her<br>obsession completely during a wonderful scene where she lets her best<br>friend see what's been going on in her life lately as she dumps the<br>bodies in a nearby lake. This is one of those &quot;one of a kind&quot; foreign<br>movies that grips you more and more as it goes on. Americans; please<br>don't be frightened by subtitles, the blood, or the fact that we get to<br>see a couple of individuals urinate into a toilet!! Let's grow up!!<br>This is a great thriller from Thailand that should be enjoyed by a lot<br>of people, not just by those who speak the same language and know the<br>way things are in the country it was made.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ruang talok 69 (1999)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>This movie is way underrated.<br>quantaumfoam<br>One of the best films...<br>wiseman-4<br>music for 69<br>alec886<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Ong-bak<br>The Whole Nine Yards<br>The Winner<br>One Eight Seven<br>Another 48 Hrs.<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
