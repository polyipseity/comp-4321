I<br>had high hopes for Hypercube but i didn't expect it to be as good or better<br>than the first. I think people would enjoy it more if they didn't expect<br>unreasonable expectations for this one.Hypercube has some flaws, but it is still entertaining. If you love Science<br>and Physics (like i do), then you will love some of the questions this film<br>proposes.I liked the darker feel of the first film more so than Hypercube. The<br>&quot;Cubes&quot; in this one are basically very bright white and it is sometimes very<br>intrusive to the eyes. I also would have liked less characters in this one.<br>One thing that worked so well in Cube 1 were the interesting characters and<br>the fact that there were not many in the film at all. This doesn't always<br>work in most films, but it worked perfectly in Cube 1.If there was one thing which i really did not like in Hypercube, it would<br>have to be the ending. It was very cheesy and way over the top. It seemed<br>like an episode of The X Files, which works just fine for a Sci-fi TV<br>series, but it just didn't work here.So, is Hypercube worth viewing? Yes it is, simply because some viewers will<br>like it more than others. It is still a better movie than most of the Sci-fi<br>movies that have been released lately. If you love the original Cube you<br>should check out Hypercube, if only to watch it one time...<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Cube 2: Hypercube (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>what a dumb dang piece of crap<br>royl-1<br>A cube in the 4th demension???<br>qwshadow<br>Worst movie in the history of film<br>bernerdawg<br>Why Simon wouldn't be able to kill Sasha...<br>msirois89<br>im sorry..the endning???<br>mjustinvirly<br>traps<br>wheelzthatkeelz<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Cube<br>Hollow Man II<br>Saw III<br>Taking Lives<br>Cube Zero<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
