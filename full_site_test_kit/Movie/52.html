Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 5 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Troubling but Timely, 1 February 2005<br>Author:<br>eht5y from United States<br>The Weatherman faction remains one of the more troubling aspects of the<br>60s counterculture, for manifold reasons. How did a bunch of<br>well-educated, relatively privileged white kids transform from<br>idealistic protesters for peace into revolutionary terrorists? How were<br>they able to reconcile the inherent contradiction of using violence as<br>a means of pursuing peace? Can violence ever lead to reconciliation, or<br>must it necessarily beget more violence? Sam Green and Bill Siegel's<br>documentary examines all of these questions while remaining remarkably<br>objective. It's a pity that we should feel surprised when a documentary<br>filmmaker actually attempts to uphold the all-but-obsolete standard of<br>objectivity; nevertheless, Green and Siegel deserve to be complimented<br>for presenting a film that is perhaps more a window into the confusion<br>of the times than a history of one peculiar faction of anti-government<br>activists.Green &amp; Siegel intersperse archival footage with commentary by a number<br>of the Weather Underground's leaders, most of whom retain their<br>revolutionary idealism, even if they have grown circumspect about their<br>methodology.The film persuasively channels the aura of violence and political<br>unrest that characterized American culture as the first vestiges of<br>counter-cultural idealism gave way first to frustration as the war in<br>Vietnam escalated and then to radicalism as, one after another, civil<br>and human rights activists ranging from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to<br>Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton were brutally silenced,<br>possibly by order of American government agencies such as the CIA, NSA,<br>and FBI. Simultaneously, the tenor of apolitical American life shifted<br>from the good vibrations of psychedelia to paranoia and suspicion. The<br>image of the blissed-out, peace-loving, groovy hippie was replaced by<br>the crazed expression of Charles Manson, whose murderous id made every<br>God-fearing citizen's worst nightmares reality: acid-crazed hippies<br>rampaging the suburbs, butchering innocents in order to start a<br>revolution that would overthrow the status quo. Siegel's and Green's<br>direction employs numerous archival clips that are shockingly graphic,<br>including horrific footage of executions and the bodies of civilian<br>casualties in Vietnam (including many women and small children) and<br>uncensored crime scene photographs from the Tate-LaBianca murders<br>ordered by Charles Manson. The material is somewhat objectionable, but<br>serves the purpose of expressing the climate of fear that made it<br>possible for the likes of Mark Rudd--now a quiet, somewhat melancholy<br>math teacher at a community college in New Mexico--to drop out of sight<br>and begin plotting the violent overthrow of the American political<br>system.The film presents the Weather Underground as admirable in its courage<br>and determination, but also as terminally misguided. Weatherman leaders<br>repeatedly express their solidarity with the Black Panthers and any<br>revolutionary movement of underclass 'brown or black' people on the<br>planet, but the few Panthers who comment for the film either disavow<br>the Weathermen or express perplexity at their determination to identify<br>with the struggle of blacks and other oppressed ethnicities. As adults,<br>several of the group members acknowledge that, even when they were<br>harassed or beaten by police, they were still treated far more humanely<br>than their black counterparts, and so were never truly in the same<br>struggle as those whom they supported. Some of the members still speak<br>nostalgically about their Weathermen days and claim that they'd do it<br>all over again; others express disdain and regret over their complicity<br>in the deaths of innocents.As we begin to see history repeating itself in Iraq, 'The Weather<br>Underground' is all too timely. What was different about the 60s and<br>70s, when so many young people became committed to political activism,<br>from the present, when the numbers are relatively few? Will the process<br>that brought about the Weather Underground repeat itself, or was this<br>particular group less a consequence of the times than of the choices of<br>a few charismatic but misguided and naive twenty-somethings? Did<br>Weatherman make a difference, or was it simply another small piece of<br>the catastrophic collage of the Vietnam era? This film raises more<br>questions than it answers--which is probably what art should always try<br>to do.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Weather Underground (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Did they really support Charlie Manson??<br>dododadadodo<br>were the weathermen right?<br>thinkingmachine<br>the weather man were LOSERS<br>wrensalert<br>Dig this<br>hoobler878<br>where is today's SDS<br>pepsivanilla<br>Another song question -slide guitar<br>adamrl-1<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Underground<br>Neverland: The Rise and Fall of the Symbionese Liberation Army<br>Punishment Park<br>In the Year of the Pig<br>Medium Cool<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
