One thing I really enjoy in movies from that neck of<br>the world is the fact that we're not dealing with professional actors<br>here. Most of the characters are played by regular Joes and it adds on<br>to the experience. &quot;Marooned in Iraq&quot; also shows the daily life of the<br>Kurds, being bombarded by Saddam's planes. Interesting look at the<br>culture, at the way of making a living, like at the brick work. As in<br>&quot;A Time for Drunken Horses&quot;, I was also very moved by the look in the<br>children's eyes. The cinematography is also beautiful. And I enjoyed<br>the traditional music. Rent this one (or get it at your local library<br>like I did) and see for yourself Mirza's odyssey. It plays almost like<br>a treasure hunt. One negative note though: I saw the film on DVD and I<br>suspect that the subtitles didn't really captured what the characters<br>were saying. Unless Kurds are using 10 words for 1 English or French<br>one, I got robbed of a lot of the dialog. Too bad.Seen at home, in Toronto, on September 16th, 2005.80/100 (***)<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gomgashtei dar Aragh (2002)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Zamani baray&#233; masti asbha<br>Niwe mung<br>David &#38; Layla<br>Kilom&#232;tre z&#233;ro<br>Takht&#233; siah<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
