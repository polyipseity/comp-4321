Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>A Concert More For Women, I Guess, 7 April 2007<br>Author:<br>ccthemovieman-1 from Lockport, NY, United States<br>I had heard several times that Neil Diamond was a fabulous performer,<br>one of the best of his generation and a big reason his concerts were<br>immensely. That inspired me to get this VHS, but I didn&#39;t find him<br>anything special. I guess he&#39;s someone who appeals a lot more to women.<br>They seemed to go nuts over him, really getting into his songs as one<br>can see on this concert tape.Actually, after awhile the women are annoying to watch, being a little<br>over-dramatic in the audience. That&#39;s nothing new. They did it back in<br>Frank Sinatra&#39;s heyday, and with Elvis and then the Beatles, etc. Anyway, I have no complaints about the music. I&#39;ve always liked most of<br>Diamond&#39;s numbers and he does them justice in this concert filmed at<br>the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles, Ca., in 1988. Most of the songs in<br>this are solid, but I&#39;d rather listen to him and see all the stupid<br>women making fools of themselves in the audience.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Neil Diamond: Greatest Hits Live (1988) (V)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>John Denver: The Wildlife Concert<br>Alabama: 41 Number One Hits Live<br>Rolling Stone Presents Twenty Years of Rock &#38; Roll<br>A Night in Havana: Dizzy Gillespie in Cuba<br>Jimi Plays Monterey<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
