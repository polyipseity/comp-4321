When I found<br>that copy, I had never even heard of the special before. But it caught<br>my attention because I&#39;m a big Monty Python fan and saw John Cleese on<br>the front cover. So I looked at the back, and it looked like a comedy<br>piece that I would want to see. So I rented it. When I watched it, I<br>wasn&#39;t disappointed. There are some mildly lame moments, but for the<br>most part, it&#39;s very funny. How To Irritate People is a mockumentary, pretending to be an<br>educational program. Narrated by John Cleese, it shows several sketches<br>that are supposed give viewers instructions on how to irritate people,<br>in various situations! Of course, these things should not be tried in<br>real life, and this whole thing was only made for entertainment.This special came out the year before the legendary comedy team Monty<br>Python started out with their hit TV series, Monty Python&#39;s Flying<br>Circus. It features three Pythons. That of course includes John Cleese,<br>and the two others are the late Graham Chapman, along with Michael<br>Palin. The humour in this special is basically the same style of humour<br>that Monty Python was always known for, so if you don&#39;t like that, then<br>there&#39;s obviously no point in watching this. I probably didn&#39;t have to<br>tell you that. But if you&#39;re a Monty Python fan, just like me, then I<br>would say that How To Irritate People is worth watching. It may not<br>quite match Monty Python&#39;s best work, but it comes close enough.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for How to Irritate People (1968) (TV)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The War Against Terror: The Musical<br>Waiting for Guffman<br>Douglas<br>Shakespeare in... and Out<br>This Is Spinal Tap<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
