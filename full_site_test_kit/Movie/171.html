Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>12 out of 17 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Colorful and energetic, but with a hackneyed script..., 4 September 2005<br>Author:<br>moonspinner55 from redlands, ca<br>Audrey Hepburn always said she was an introvert forced by her<br>profession into playing extroverts, and usually that strain didn&#39;t<br>show. It doesn&#39;t show in &quot;Funny Face&quot; either, but her natural gamine<br>appeal does seem to get swallowed up in the fake-happy surroundings.<br>The Oscar-nominated screenplay about a famous photographer discovering<br>a beauty in a mousy Greenwich Village book-clerk is only good in its<br>early stages setting up the story, but when we find that the plot is<br>just a romance complication, it&#39;s a let-down. The plot-thread about the<br>philosopher in Paris is dire, and the film laughably compares a beatnik<br>lecture to a spiritual, but Hepburn works hard to create chemistry<br>between she and Fred Astaire (older and less enthused) and she has some<br>feisty, enchanting moments. She does her own singing here, unlike in<br>the later &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (which coincidentally also gave Audrey a<br>fashionable makeover), and her dancing is sprightly and fun. It&#39;s a<br>fluttery, gay, fashion-magazine movie without enough soul in it to<br>really be absorbing, but the Gershwin songs are sweet and the<br>eye-popping color-schemes give it a great visual kick. ** from ****<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Funny Face (1957)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Why is 'Funny Face' loved??<br>classics4me<br>The Clothes<br>crazygirl2306<br>Great Audrey Film..<br>calisa<br>Fake romance<br>vinum90035<br>Who choreographed what?
