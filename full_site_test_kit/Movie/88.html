Episodes 1-8 start after the 8th episode of the OAV series. They are based on the original Record of Lodoss War novels #3-4 by Ryo Mizuno entitled &#34;The Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain I &#38; II&#34;. Episodes 9-27 follow the stories of the original novels #6-7 entitled &#34;The Holy Knight of Lodoss I &#38; II&#34;. Which in turn spawned the manga (18 issues) &#38; graphic novels (6 books) available in English from CPM Manga entitled &#34;Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight&#34;. It is that manga series that the name of this anime series comes. Some people believe that the writers and directors &#34;rewrote&#34; the story found in episodes 9-13 in the OAV series, where in reality the intent was to convey the story as it was originally written by Mr. Mizuno the Lodoss series author and creator.<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>Narrator:<br>There once was a boy, who dreamt of living in a world of light.

(relates to dubbed version), 25 February 2001<br>Author:<br>pixie468 from Southern Florida<br>&quot;Record of the Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight&quot; is an awesome 27<br>episode anime series. The first eight (or so) episodes are about the free<br>knight Parn, his elven companion Deedlit, and many others who make a<br>wonderful mercenary group. They cast spells, fight evil beings, and prevent<br>a black knight from taking control of Lodoss, the Accursed Island.The following 19 episodes are my favorite though. It's nine years later, and<br>the knight-in-training Spark and his recruited soldiers must save the world<br>from a dark sorcerer and cunning goddess. The animation is very colorful and<br>clean. The dialogue could use some help,<br>but the voices that speak it are very intelligible and appropriate. I loved<br>the action, and I couldn't help myself from rooting for the the &quot;bad guys&quot;<br>in some cases. This television series is a great find for anime fans and<br>fantasy/adventure lovers. I cheered, laughed, cried, and even dreamed about<br>this series.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for &#34;Lodoss to Senki: Eiyuu kishi den&#34; (1998)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Lodoss to senki<br>&#34;Slayers&#34;<br>&#34;Bakuretsu hunters&#34;<br>Banpaia hant&#226; D<br>Ganso bakuretsu hunter<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
