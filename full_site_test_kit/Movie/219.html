They&#39;re brilliant<br>works.But this is horrifically off the mark.The review of Davies&#39; version of Edith Wharton&#39;s *House of Mirth* in<br>the NY Times said that the movie was more like Charles Dickens than<br>Edith Wharton. Which is exactly the criticism I had of this movie.<br>These folks are not embodying American Southern farmers, they&#39;re acting<br>like industrial working class people. I can understand and be<br>sympathetic to the original story: my people, coming from South<br>Carolina &amp; Georgia, had lives very similar to the plot of this movie.<br>Therefore, I could see where this could potentially be a very good<br>film.But nothing gets under my skin like an inability to see beyond one&#39;s<br>own cultural bias...which is the major mistake of the director of this<br>production. If you take the emotions, the gestures, the imagery of this<br>film and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie.<br>But having people interact and react this way and have them being<br>farmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark. If<br>you want to see true southern Americana, skip this movie and see Elia<br>Kazan&#39;s *Wild River* instead...<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Neon Bible (1995)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The House of Mirth<br>George Washington<br>Wisconsin Death Trip<br>Gods and Monsters<br>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
