He is a assassin who<br>lives by the code of the Samurai. Apart from him, we also follow the fate of<br>several mafia men(though nowhere near as intimately as we follow Ghost Dog).<br>These two very different groups, Samurai and mafia, are both depicted<br>reasonably well, giving us insight to how the groups work, and, more<br>importantly, their code. Both groups live and die by the code, and this is<br>probably the most important thing in the movie, and it's shown with respect<br>with both Samurai and mafia; I'm not entirely sure that it's correct all the<br>way through, but that's not what's most important, anyway. The film has<br>reasonably little action, but it's not supposed to be an action film, by any<br>means. It's fairly slow throughout the film, but it never really bores you<br>to the point of not watching any more; I've seen the film at least five<br>times now, so believe me, I know. The film is very stylized and cool<br>throughout, which definitely has some part in keeping you interested, but<br>the theme and story/plot plays a bigger part, I think. The plot is pretty<br>good, and though it keeps a fairly slow pace throughout the film, it also<br>keeps your interest for the entire duration of the film. The acting is all<br>good, though not everyone pulls off as excellent a performance as Whitaker.<br>Isaach De Bankol&eacute; portrays Ghost Dog's best friend, and he does gives a<br>great performance. So does Camille Winbush, who portrays a girl who Ghost<br>Dog befriends and discusses books with. The characters are well-written<br>and(mostly) credible. I'm not entirely sure that the film does provide a<br>totally correct version of the Code of the Samurai. The soundtrack is great;<br>it's made by the hip-hop artist RZA, but most of it will be enjoyable to<br>people who aren't into hip-hop. Also, I guess it's more of a score than a<br>soundtrack; there isn't any time where the music feels out of place in a<br>scene. All in all, a great film, but not for all tastes. Don't go in<br>expecting an action film; don't go in expecting a very deep an entirely<br>intellectual film; don't go in expecting a regular movie; go in expecting to<br>see a decent(if not good) representation of both the mafia code and the<br>Samurai code. I've heard some people describe the ending as an anti-climax;<br>I don't know what they were expecting... I won't say that I saw it coming,<br>but I wasn't disappointed when it happened. It had to end it, and I think<br>the director, Jim Jarmusch made a good decision on that. I recommend this<br>film to people with an interest in Samurai, fans of Jarmusch and people<br>looking for a reasonably deep film. I don't recommend this to fans of action<br>movies, as there's fairly little action in the film. No matter who you are,<br>if you're going to see this film, make sure you have the patience for it;<br>it's worth sitting through the two reasonably slow hours for.<br>8/10<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Outstanding<br>Nick_Hanson<br>should a great man lay down his life in the service of a lesser man?<br>jarmyta<br>The Blackequivalent to 'Grand Theft Auto' fantasies?<br>NeroKalem<br>*beep*<br>corybracken<br>are you serious??<br>nvp12345<br>Style over substance?
