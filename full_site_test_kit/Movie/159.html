The plot of a timid ordinary citizen being mistaken for a hardened criminal and becoming involved in catching the crooks goes back in US film history at least to John Ford's The Whole Town's Talking (1935), a comedy-drama that starred Edward G. Robinson in a similar dual role.<br>more<br>Goofs:<br>Continuity: When Troshkin is being hit by Mikola in prison, Troshkin's pants already have a dirt mark in the back, most probably from rehearsals.<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>Vasily Alibabayevich:<br>[Reading Khmyr's child's letter] Dear dad!

Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>22 out of 22 people found the following comment useful:-<br>A truly classic Russian comedy, 10 April 2002<br>Author:<br>George Freedman (geosochi@yahoo.com) from Glendale, California<br>This is my favorite Russian comedy, and although it is 30 years old, people<br>still enjoy it more than most other comedies today. A satiric and witty<br>movie that revolves around an adventurous plot. The plot is basically that<br>a<br>convict (Dotsent) escapes from prison and the militia (Russian police) find<br>the criminal's lookalike, a kindergarten teacher. He goes undercover and<br>pretends to be a criminal to help the militia find the where the real<br>convict has hidden a stolen mask. He makes a phony escape from the prison<br>with two others, who think he is the real Dotsent. He eventually befriends<br>with them and they become attached, but I won't reveal the rest. From my<br>plot review it might seem as a violent movie or something like that, but<br>actually it is good for the entire family. The movie is entertaining<br>throughout and if you want to see a comparison with an American equivalent,<br>it's like a lot like Seinfeld because it's a situational comedy. If you are<br>a fan of Russian cinematography and haven't seen this one, watch it right<br>away because this is a true classic with some of the greatest Russian<br>actors<br>(see cast).<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gentlemeny udachy (1972)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Naked Gun 2&#189;: The Smell of Fear<br>Bal-Can-Can<br>Sreda obitaniya<br>The Whole Town's Talking<br>Mimino<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
