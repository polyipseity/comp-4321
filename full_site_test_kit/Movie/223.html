Comedy Central had to pull the show from its 2005 schedule leaving the future of the show uncertain. The network decided to shelve the completed sketches hoping Chappelle would eventually return to finish the season. After Chappelle publicly announced that he had no intention of returning to the show, Comedy Central decided to repackage some of the completed sketches and air them in 2006. The sketches were presented minus the introductory wraparounds Chappelle used to do as host as those segments had not been taped before Chappelle left. Charles Q.

Dave is the<br>funniest thing on tv hands down. Comedy Central knows it and apparently<br>everyone but one user on here knows it too. The Charlie Murphy episodes<br>are<br>brilliant. However, the 'Wayne Brady' skit was one of the most funniest<br>skits I've ever seen in my lifetime. I got to work the next day and the<br>entire department was quoting from it. It's been a while for a comedy show<br>to come along and have such an impact on 'all of us'. I'm looking forward<br>to<br>the third season. Dave, Keep up the good work.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for &#34;Chappelle's Show&#34; (2003)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Name of song in 'Mad Real World'??<br>wzup31<br>the wrap-it-up skit<br>TheWoozy<br>Songs?????????<br>djclueboy<br>is it coming back?<br>stingbutt1<br>who's this hot gal in season 3?<br>f5combo<br>Top Ten Rememorable Sketches of Chappelle<br>Ztornado6<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>&#34;Rowan &#38; Martin's Laugh-In&#34;<br>Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br>South Park: Bigger Longer &#38; Uncut<br>&#34;SKETCH, Inc.&#34;<br>&#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
