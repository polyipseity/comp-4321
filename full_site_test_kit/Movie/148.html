Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>7 out of 8 people found the following comment useful:-<br>This film deserves a good review..., 29 April 2006<br>Author:<br>MarieGabrielle from United States<br>Especially since I am not really a fan of romantic comedies/drama. This<br>is not really a comedy per se, as there is a dramatic element to it,<br>and the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is not<br>playing a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. This is<br>a good thing, especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron&#39;s<br>performance as Sara Deaver, a quirky girl who Nelson (Keanu) meets at<br>the DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop- the<br>positive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another character<br>in the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry, the local cross-dresser who is Theron&#39;s<br>friend and confidante. He does well in this, and last night I actually<br>saw him in &quot;Friends With Money&quot;, wherein his talent was literally<br>wasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner, who is quasi-adopted by Theron and<br>Reeves, as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes, like where Greg Germann (Reeves&#39; co-worker<br>at an ad agency) orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress.<br>Also where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs, and he<br>eventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film; I am not a big<br>fan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent,<br>as always, and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in San<br>Francisco, a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sweet November (2001)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>The ending made me cry<br>sst1987<br>Autumn in NY<br>Laney_girl08<br>Keanu singing<br>rosie_rou<br>She doesn't die.<br>nicholassixx<br>'take the 80 to Oakland'<br>nam-turk<br>what is ernie!??<br>krxy04<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Sabrina<br>The Other Sister<br>Here on Earth<br>Beaches<br>Jerry Maguire<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
