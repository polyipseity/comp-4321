I thought it would be a remake of Titanic and it was in<br>the first half a bit like it but in the second half it was totally<br>different. Aamir Khan was good and played the charming hero, Manisha<br>Koirala<br>was fantastic and Anil Kapoor was excellent!The film is about Dev Karan Singh (Aamir Khan), who is a womanizer who is<br>already engaged to some rich brat but still goes after the woman but never<br>actually loves any of them until one day he goes on a cruise and meets a<br>girl he's crazy about Priya (Manisha Koirala), who won in a fancy dress<br>contest to go on a cruise. Priya and dev meet and dev hits on her the first<br>time he sees her and later she gets to love him too and goes along with him<br>to meet his grandma (Sharmila Tagore). The two reveal they're both getting<br>engaged and vow to break of their marriages and meet at the gateway of<br>india<br>on valentine's day and Priya says to Dev to make something of himself and<br>stand on his own two feet. At the airport their partners to be arrive to<br>pick them up and Priya's alliance turns out to be Anil Kapoor and Dev's<br>alliance turns out to be someone who i don't know the name of and there the<br>two separate.Dev finally breaks off his marriage and becomes poor and makes a living by<br>painting and as for Priya she doesn't have the heart to break to break off<br>her marriage but afterwards he finds out and is fine with it and he helps<br>her get ready for valentine's day. When the day comes the two are on their<br>way but something happens to Priya...........Mann is good dispite it was a flop in India i think i may be wrong but i<br>think it was. Mann deserves a 9.9 out of 10.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Mann (1999)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Music Copied...!!!<br>Indus_Bull<br>COPY!!!!<br>rheaisgreat<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!<br>Hungama<br>Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein<br>Khushi<br>Akele Hum Akele Tum<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
