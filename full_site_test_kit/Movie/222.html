Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>we can hope for better, 5 June 2001<br>Author:<br>xhari_nairx from Oakland, CA<br>I'm always on the look out for American films that actually acknowledge that<br>there are more than two races in America.Unfortunately, while YELLOW does<br>in fact feature Korean Americans, it fails in too many ways.The title<br>itself is an in-your-face attempt to say &quot;Hey!! THIS is<br>Asian-Americanism!!!&quot;The characters seem to have been created to fulfill<br>the film maker's desire to represent Korean Americans.That's a trap that a<br>lot of films about ethnic minorities fall into, but sometimes with skilled<br>writing that purpose can be fulfilled while still creating characters that<br>seem real.Not so in this case, and in fact, they characters and story<br>don't give you any genuine feel for the issues facing Korean Americans<br>anyway.No point in taking the actors to task for their performances... the<br>finest thespians couldn't make these character's motivations tangible.The<br>story suffers from the &quot;dummy-plot&quot; syndrome.... there would be no story if<br>the characters weren't stupid.The story drifts aimlessly from one<br>contrived event to another.It eventually reaches such levels of<br>ridiculousness that you're wondering if the film maker just added scenes in<br>because it would be fun to shoot.That all being said... Chris Chan Lee<br>might have a good film in him.At times he displays a good visual sense.<br>Maybe if he was working with a writer who could craft a convincing story<br>with genuine emotion.But unfortunately, YELLOW is a film worth watching<br>only if you're writing a term paper on Asian American film.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Yellow (1998)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Any similar?<br>meis760-1<br>Michael Chung<br>youngjun91<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Baby It's You<br>Is It College Yet?<br>My Best Friend's Wife<br>The Perfect Weapon<br>Do the Right Thing<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
