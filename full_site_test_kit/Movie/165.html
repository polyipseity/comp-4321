His self deprecating style is simply perfect and<br>extraordinarily funny.I have seen this show several times on cable and I laugh often and out<br>loud<br>throughout every time. The opening 20 minutes have some of the funniest<br>stuff I have ever heard particularly the bits about his relationships.<br>And<br>his description of Jim Brown trying to save him from crack addiction and<br>the<br>stories of his subsequent hospitilization for burn treatment are<br>hilarious.Highly recommended.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip (1982)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Richard Pryor ...Here and Now<br>Richard Pryor: Live in Concert<br>Richard Pryor: Live and Smokin'<br>Eddie Murphy Raw<br>Eddie Murphy Delirious<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
