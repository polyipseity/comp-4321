Kilmer is very good in here, one of his<br>best performances ever and the film is nicely photographed. The only<br>warning I would give viewers is the language, which contains about 25<br>f-words.The best plug I can give this film is that it was very entertaining,<br>start to finish, and that's what most of us are looking for -<br>entertainment. It keeps your attention the full 100-plus minutes, so<br>what's not to like? As mentioned, Kilmer is very, very good in here<br>and, make no mistake: he's the show. Everything in the story really<br>revolves around him.There was anything that struck a sour note with me, it would be the<br>story with the kidnapped girl's father. I don't think he was realistic,<br>but I won't say more in fear of spoiling anything for those who haven't<br>seen this.Nonetheless, an under-publicized excellent film of 2004.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Spartan (2004)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Blanks?<br>superrjon<br>Problems with this film - and there are many (spoilers)<br>bobbykivistik<br>Soundtrack<br>neoengel127<br>Whooaaaaa - Pleasantly Suprised<br>coffeefilter<br>Salton Sea reference?<br>Nick_Dets<br>6.8???<br>roca_sta69<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Road House<br>Along Came a Spider<br>Basic<br>The Da Vinci Code<br>The Sum of All Fears<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
