The film made me feel like a<br>fool because I couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and<br>the nonsensical characters. But I felt kind of embarrassed to admit to<br>myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots. So I stuck with it<br>to the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself.<br>Then I realised.... the film is SUPPOSED to be serpentine, nonsensical<br>and illogical, because that's the whole point. This is a satirical look<br>at conspiracy theories and theorists, with the knotting-up of the plot<br>used as a metaphor for the knotting-up of truths, half-truths and lies<br>that define any conspiracy. Even when I got that the joke was on me, I<br>still felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie.Young Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) is the younger brother of a former<br>United States President who was assassinated in Philadelphia. Nick is<br>present when a dying man claims that he shot the President and gives<br>detailed information about where he hid the gun. Nick follows the<br>clues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in<br>mysterious circumstances. Also, his father Pa Kegan (John Huston), a<br>vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman, keeps interfering with<br>Nick's investigation. The deeper he delves into the assassination, the<br>more Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and<br>red herrings, where nothing is as it seems and no-one can be trusted.The film is an utter nightmare to follow, and in many ways is not worth<br>trying to follow for the afore-mentioned reason that it deliberately<br>tangles itself up. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but<br>most of them are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest and<br>most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history; Elizabeth Taylor<br>appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue; Richard Boone<br>is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes<br>nowhere. John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and<br>provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic<br>delivery. Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well,<br>though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the<br>character. Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason<br>and, while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs, they<br>really belong in another film. The film's semi-comic climax is farcical<br>and disappointing, yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way.<br>There's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for Winter<br>Kills.... but I won't be counting myself among its number.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Winter Kills (1979)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Whata Cast<br>ecarle<br>What really happened to this movie?<br>ukkid35<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Wag the Dog<br>The Second Civil War<br>Being There<br>Man of the Year<br>JFK<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
