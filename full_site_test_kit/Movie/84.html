The quality is leaps and bounds over the series, and<br>the movie is made to be a fan's dream. The entire movie start to finish<br>seems made with the fan in mind. The animation quality is top notch. From<br>the little things like eye movement to the big things like debris and<br>destruction of a city. It's all done superbly well and it all looks<br>absolutely wonderful.The story is quite nice as well, though nothing too extreme. They managed to<br>squeeze in the origins of just about anything and everything. Yet, it never<br>seems forced... there's never a scene that was obviously put in just to<br>explain something.The sound and music is perfect with the movie. The music fits it very well<br>and the subtle cues really draw the fans in. The VA's do a wonderful job as<br>well, there's really nothing to dislike.It's far from a deep movie, and it's certainly no epic animation. But for<br>fans of the show it's PPG perfection. For folks yet to see the show, it's a<br>very entertaining flick well worth your time. The full length commentary on<br>the dvd by the director and art director is well worth watching by itself.<br>Not only is it great to hear a behind the scenes look, there's many great<br>tips for artists spread around on how they made certain effects and made<br>some effects easier. The commentary is worth the rental<br>alone.- Rirath_com<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Powerpuff Girls (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Movie was announced in year 2000<br>Beletje<br>About Mojo JoJo's plan......<br>angussu<br>Where's the Extra Guy????<br>yomi_15<br>Why did I even watch it?<br>David_Howard<br>VERY DISSAPOINTING<br>pinknavelring<br>Favorite Powerpuff<br>powerpuffkn-1<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Incredibles<br>The Flintstones<br>Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams<br>Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over<br>The Transformers: The Movie<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
