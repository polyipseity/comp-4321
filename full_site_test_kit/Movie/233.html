Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-<br>A masterpiece !, 26 May 2006<br>Author:<br>wmjahn from Austria<br>Did anyone notice that Charlie made 2 of his best (maybe his best)<br>pictures one after another, both directed by Michael Winner (who did<br>some more nice entries in the Bronson catalog), both scored by Jerry<br>Fiedling (superbly, if I may add), &quot;CHATO&#39;S LAND&quot; and &quot;THE MECHANIC&quot;<br>(from whom Tarantine chose to quote in &quot;Kill Bill II&quot;) ??!! I must have<br>watched both movies app. half a dozen times and they seem to get better<br>with every viewing (despite knowing its ending)! First, these are films made for men, not children or family-viewing.<br>And let&#39;s be honest, if you wanna see a good, though, well played movie<br>today, what you&#39;re gonna do?? Certainly not go to the cinema, were you<br>see noisy, trashy high-budget trash in a row. You buy yourself a DVD or<br>watch some late-night viewing of a 70ies movie on TV! And these two<br>movies are certainly as good as it can get! Second, these movies are more less silent! You don&#39;t hear some silly<br>dialog through it all, but just men saying a few words, when it&#39;s<br>really needed. Those people, who talk a lot in such movies, are happily<br>the first ones that gonna be shot (and it&#39;s good this way)! Everybody&#39;s<br>always pointing out who little Arnold is saying in &quot;TERMINATOR&quot; (of<br>course the first one), a real good movie, too! Well, get yourself<br>CHATO&#39;S LAND. In the German dubbed version good old Charlie (God bless<br>him!) spoke less than 10 words in German and maybe another dozen or so<br>in some tribal language, that&#39;s it! I&#39;d take a bet that there is most<br>likely no other non-silent movie every made, in which the hero says as<br>few words as in this one!! And while we&#39;re at comparing it to Schwarzenegger/Terminator, did<br>anybody notice those MUSCLES of Charlie??!! And these are certainly no<br>anabolic-stuff, but real hard &amp; honest earned ones! If we&#39;d take<br>Charlie in his prime (when he made this one, he was HALF A CENTURY OLD<br>= 50 years!!!) and compare it to Schwarzenegger, when he was 50 not<br>that long ago ... I&#39;d say Charlie would have wiped the carpet with him,<br>should there have been any reason for an argument. I&#39;d just wish I&#39;d<br>have looked that well, when I was 30, not to speak of being 50 (not<br>yet).The guy is just SO COOL in this movie as well as in THE MECHANIC (and<br>many more in fact))! OK, I hear the critics saying, this is just a &quot;silly&quot; revenge-movie<br>(note: made before DEATH WISH I !!). Nope, it ain&#39;t !! First, it&#39;s not<br>that important, what the story is, what really counts is how it is<br>delivered: movie-experts doing what they can at the highest level! It&#39;s<br>just GREAT to watch them delivering all the expected scenes without<br>getting whimsical, talky or making compromises. This is a men&#39;s movie<br>made for men! And second, it&#39;s not stupid at all! Why does everybody<br>has to go on his knees in front of authorities (the sheriff)? Esp. if<br>you&#39;re part of a badly treated minority! He&#39;s on his own, when a big<br>crowd invades HIS LAND (like the USA did in Vietnam) and he wipes them<br>off. He knows the land better than everybody else, he&#39;s trained and<br>intelligent (the followers are more stupid, but not completely), so he<br>does what he has to do. At the end the winner is logical and probably<br>that&#39;s the movie, Mr. Bush should have watched before entering the<br>Iraque ...OK, back to the movie. What about the acting? Wooden??? Come on, it<br>ain&#39;t, it&#39;s just perfect for this movie!! Would you like to see some<br>what-they-call-&quot;actor&quot;-today (say, Adrien Brody, who wasn&#39;t too<br>convincing in KING KONG either) delivering this?? It would just be<br>&quot;strange&quot;/ridiculous. And the other members of the crew? Just perfect!<br>Palance, superb (as always, but he should have avoided City Slickers),<br>Basehart and Whitmore, great! Just the kinda support crew one needs and<br>which is simply non-existent today (and which is sadly missed!).One critic complained about the &quot;cheap look&quot; (??) of the movie, and<br>that it must have been inexpensive to make. Well, so what? First,<br>blockbusters suck anyway, every 2 minutes an explosion is just noisy<br>and boring (but obviously expensive) anyway and the scenery is in fact<br>superbly chosen! It&#39;s just THE MAN, the scenery and his doomed<br>followers. The land is as bleak as the fate of the followers/hunters.<br>It&#39;s empty, it&#39;s pure, it&#39;s honest, it&#39;s something for &quot;desert-rats&quot;.<br>:-)) So to sum up: you can&#39;t chose better for a great action movie of<br>the 70ies (and that&#39;w when most of the great actions movies were<br>made!).Moreless the same can be said about THE MECHANIC: tough, not-talky,<br>thrilling, superbly shot and acted, great support cast, too, and what<br>an ending !!! I&#39;d LOVE to see these out on DVD with much bonus material<br>(scenes from the set, one of Carlies too rare interviews: well, the guy<br>stayed silent when there was not much too say, smile, although I would<br>love him to still be among us and write some great autobiography!)!What a loss, but then again he&#39;s hopefully having superb times,<br>wherever he&#39;s now!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chato's Land (1972)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>BRONSON at his best - areal masterpiece!<br>wmjahn<br>Apache Kid<br>snoorton<br>Why had the 2 last guys have to suffer most?
