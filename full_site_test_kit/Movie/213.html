Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>4 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Delicious Slice of One Night of NY Restaurant Life, 28 October 2005<br>Author:<br>noralee from Queens, NY<br>&quot;Dinner Rush&quot; will inevitably be compared to &quot;Big Night,&quot; and other<br>food preparation/restaurant movies, but I think it holds its own as a<br>delicious slice of one night of New York life. As one character<br>plotzes: &quot;When did eating out become theater?&quot; The wonderful, winsome multi-ethnic ensemble of mostly New York actors<br>--many born in Brooklyn according to the IMDb--who have done a lot of<br>TV work are clearly enjoying making a movie as a coordinated team.<br>Danny Aiello has his best, and somewhat similar, role since &quot;City<br>Hall.&quot; Many of the references may go over the heads of those West of the<br>Hudson or East of the East River, whether to Tribeca (as a newly trendy<br>neighborhood) or Danny Meyer (restaurant entrepreneur). Or even the<br>digs at Queens as the home of mobsters, which were greeted by silence<br>by the Queens audience I saw it with.The upstairs/downstairs of the kitchen scrambles vs. the dining<br>pleasures and everyone's personal spices are lots of fun. The actors<br>playing obnoxious customers, like Sandra Bernhard, do so with relish<br>but not overplayed.Keep your palate clear by not looking at the ad campaign or reading the<br>reviews, as I think they give the plot away and I was totally surprised<br>by the ending, er, the dessert.(originally written 9/29/2001)<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Dinner Rush (2000)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Best character in movie<br>neilsugg<br>What's the game they're playing?<br>entropy-10<br>sound problems?<br>fred-49<br>bathroom hit song<br>bluegrassish<br>Who did the music for this movie?<br>biodmed<br>worth buying?<br>LunarJunk89<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Fly Away Baby<br>It's Always Fair Weather<br>Goodfellas<br>A Man Betrayed<br>East Side Kids<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
