I bought Sleepover<br>Nightmare because it was filmed at my favorite performer's house. But<br>it's an okay movie. I'm glad most of the gore was implied rather than<br>explicitly shown! Same for the sex scenes. And the characters at least<br>showed some sense by sticking together once they realized what was<br>happening.It did seem odd that the party ended so early and most of the kids left<br>so soon, but I suppose that was necessary so more attention could be<br>focused on the main characters.A question though - don't Canadian cars have airbags, especially the<br>police cars? All those car crashes and not one airbag deployed? Give me<br>a break! Still, I think this is a movie that people who like this genre<br>would enjoy.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sleepover Nightmare (2005) (V)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>boon collins films<br>redneckdan76<br>what the hell was this?<br>warr10r<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Slaughter High<br>Freddy vs. Jason<br>The Fear: Resurrection<br>A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge<br>Hide and Go Shriek<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
