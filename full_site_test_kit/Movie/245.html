Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-<br>pretty good, 7 May 2002<br>Author:<br>Arnoldo_2002 from chicago<br>The list of problems I had with this film is long, and I agree with<br>many of the comments I've read and heard about the film,that it's<br>unoriginal and a knock-off of Boyz in the Hood, but you know what?<br>Who cares?This film is actually pretty good and has a strong<br>sense of humor to counterbalance it's more serious side. After a<br>half an hour of snickering at some awkward scenes, I gradually<br>began to get hooked, and by the time thepowerful climax arrived,<br>the director and the actors had won me over. Sure, the film isn't<br>perfect and some scenes don't work, but rarely do Latinos get 30<br>million dollars to make their personal films, if given the chance to<br>make films at all. Despite what some people have written about<br>this film, the cinematography is excellent, and so are some of the<br>actors like Jacob Vargas, and the guy who played Gramps is<br>terrifying. The director did a great job with the few resources he<br>had and his heart and passion are evident in every frame. One<br>thing that bothers me, particularly from fellow Latinos, is that<br>they're always ready to knock a film like this by calling it negative,<br>or calling it &quot;typical&quot; or saying things like &quot;not all latinos grew up in<br>the hood&quot;. Fine. Make your own movie! If you don't like hood<br>movies don't watch them, but don't knock a filmmaker for making a<br>movie about something he cares about, just like I wouldn't knock<br>Scorcese for making another &quot;gangster picture&quot;, or the coen<br>Brothers for making another &quot;film noir&quot; picture. Film is film, and if<br>it's well done I'm ready to give it a shot, regardless of the subject<br>matter.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Road Dogz (2000)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>My Family<br>The Ice Storm<br>Welcome to the Dollhouse<br>The Virgin Suicides<br>Liberty Heights<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
