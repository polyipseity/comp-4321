Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>4 out of 5 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Whoopi whips it up, 17 March 1999<br>Author:<br>DeeDee-10 from San Francisco<br>Rita Rizzoli (Whoopi Goldberg) is going to put the drug king out of business<br>who is producing a deadly drug that's killing people off at an alarming<br>rate. The drug king's top security man, Mike Marshak (Sam Elliott), takes a<br>shine to Rita, although we aren't sure why. I spent the entire film thinking<br>he might be an undercover cop -not so. Had it been any other actor besides<br>Elliott I think this flaw might have prevented the film from being<br>believable. But Elliott, and his cool, understated style just swept me away<br>with his obvious attraction to Rita. There are some very moving moments,<br>some frighteningly real back alley scenes of drug dealings and shootout<br>after shootout. I didn't know what to expect with this film, and was hoping<br>Whoopi would sail with it. She did!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Fatal Beauty (1987)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Whoopi looked hot!!<br>kissshot85<br>Laughing Chinese guy<br>seblud<br>Name of dog<br>stillsexy<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Beverly Hills Cop<br>Shaft<br>The French Connection<br>Lethal Weapon<br>Traffic<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
