Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-<br>vocal major, 2005., 8 November 2005<br>Author:<br>ayefrsty from United States<br>I actually just graduated from LaGuardia HS, the HS that &quot;Fame&quot; was<br>based on as a vocal major (2005). People do not know what LaGuardia HS<br>is until I mention that it's the &quot;Fame&quot; school. In my four years of<br>being a student there, I did not watch &quot;Fame&quot;. In fact, I just saw it 4<br>days ago. There are two teachers from the movie that currently teach at<br>LaGuardia, Penny Frank and Jim Moody.There were some things that did not connect, obviously. For instance,<br>you would never do pointe freshman year. It captured the student's<br>spirits very well, however we never broke into song and dance during<br>lunch, we were too busy eating!! Some people will have their<br>instruments and jam a bit in the lunchroom or senior lounge. In between<br>breaks, the dance majors are still in their leotards grabbing lunch.<br>Music majors have blackout days, where they come into school directly<br>into the concert hall and not class and rehearse all day. What I do<br>miss about the school is seeing people cut class to hang out in the<br>hallway and work on their harmonies. Figuring out math problems while<br>down the hall, a class would be studying their new Italian aria.I did not feel as if the movie was amazing. In terms of capturing the<br>spirit of the students, it was incredible. The struggles that all the<br>students went through was definitely a reality. There were many things<br>left out in the movie, especially the endings of various situations<br>between the students.I miss LaGuardia though. Never will I go to a school like that with<br>people as interesting. I'm in college now and haven't really found<br>people interesting enough to stimulate my mind. I am proud to be a<br>graduate of the Fame school, for it was the best four years of my life.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Fame (1980)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>The Play- Fame on stage!!<br>DarkPrincess1989<br>appropriate?<br>hazelnutty73<br>Fame Part Two<br>Camelot_2000<br>Favorite Scene<br>maggiemoon83<br>The Musical Script?<br>phiil24<br>Meg Tilly<br>Wilde_child<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>American Beauty<br>Once Upon a Time in America<br>Ellie Parker<br>Winter Passing<br>All That Jazz<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
