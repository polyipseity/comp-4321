Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-<br>An Unbelievable Coupling, 20 July 2000<br>Author:<br>gbheron from Washington, DC<br>Tracy and Hepburn's first movie is like two separate movies in one. One is a<br>screwball comedy that takes up most of the first half of the movie. It<br>covers the romance between Sam, the average Joe sports columnist, and Tess,<br>the sophisticated, globe-trotting political columnist. The scenes where they<br>both try and adapt to the others life are hysterical.The second movie covers the relationship as it implausibly deepens into<br>romance, leading to marriage. The clash of lifestyles and personalities<br>drives the couple further and further apart endangering the marriage.This<br>movie is not a comedy.The first half of the movie is mostly comedy, the second mostly drama.<br>Comedy does raise it's head throughout, and this, in my opinion saves the<br>movie from catastrophe. As it is, it's pretty good, but not a classic by any<br>stretch in my opinion.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Woman of the Year (1942)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>The Couple's Bed<br>gjampol<br>Best pairing of Hepburn + Tracy?<br>peartree1402<br>wedding ceremony<br>homestead-2<br>classical music in the background?<br>miss_penny_lane<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>His Girl Friday<br>Intolerable Cruelty<br>I Love Trouble<br>One Fine Day<br>Much Ado About Nothing<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
