Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Propaganda movie with a love triangle thrown in, 9 August 2005<br>Author:<br>blanche-2 from United States<br>Fantastic special effects highlight this World War II submarine drama<br>starring Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews, and Anne Baxter - Power's last<br>before going into the Marines.Power is charming as a man who captures the heart of Anne Baxter, who<br>though he doesn't know it, just happens to be the girl of Dana Andrews,<br>Power's new commanding officer.Out on the submarine, there's some exciting action as the sub searches<br>for a secret base set up by the Nazis. One interesting subplot is the<br>friendship of Oliver, a black soldier, with Mac, portrayed by James<br>Gleason. Ben Carter, who played Oliver, does a great job, and his role<br>as a concerned friend and brave soldier is not the usual stereotypical<br>one blacks were often forced to play. The ending, of course, is pure propaganda as Power, supposedly talking<br>to his uncle, talks about the fighting men, subs, PT boats, and the<br>like all doing their job. I'm in no way trying to denigrate it -<br>propaganda is a fascinating part of film history and at that time was<br>deemed important to the war movement. It's all very interesting to view<br>today. And Power is gorgeous.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Crash Dive (1943)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Lifeboat<br>The Guns of Navarone<br>Raiders of the Lost Ark<br>Action in the North Atlantic<br>Hell Below<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
