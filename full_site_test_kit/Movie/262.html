The &#34;doctors&#34; have a red cross on the hood and the headlights have &#34;pupils.&#34; The &#34;doctors&#34; have mechanical arms that hold welding torches and other mechanical tools. The scene was probably deleted because it would have been too scary for kids.<br>more<br>Goofs:<br>Revealing mistakes: One of the Volkswagens in the Volkswagen fleet has a young couple kissing in the back seat.

Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>1 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>The Disney people in desperation mode..., 4 September 2005<br>Author:<br>moonspinner55 from redlands, ca<br>Although it was a hit with kids, this sequel to 1968's &quot;The Love Bug&quot;<br>flounders around for some sort of inspiration, finding it only in the<br>multiple flashbacks to the first picture. There's hardly a whiff of a<br>plot, Helen Hayes looks uncomfortable, and Ken Berry is a poor man's<br>Dean Jones. Worse, the special effects are shoddy, the production<br>values cheap, and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director who<br>practically prods you in the ribs. The Disney Company really lost more<br>than their boss when Walt died; they lost their direction, most<br>especially in their live-action entertainment, relying on sequels and<br>(even today) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding of<br>what their founder was trying to do. &quot;Herbie&quot; is surely at that<br>barrel's bottom.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Herbie Rides Again (1974)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo<br>Herbie Fully Loaded<br>The Love Bug<br>Herbie Goes Bananas<br>Toy Story 2<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
