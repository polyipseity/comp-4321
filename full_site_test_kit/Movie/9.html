Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-<br>Good Troma-tic fun., 30 April 2006<br>Author:<br>John Lindsey (Johnlindsey289@hotmail.Com) from Socorro, New Mexico USA.<br>A couple of years after the original movie, Tromaville has gotten a new<br>university merged with the nuclear power plant called &quot;The Tromaville<br>Institute of Technology ( a.k.a. TIT)&quot; and it seems like a perfect<br>place to have campus life with booze, hot chicks who wear bikinis, and<br>being yourself. However a scientist named Professor Holt ( Lisa Gaye)<br>has been creating humanoid beings out of chemicals called Sub-Humanoids<br>who are perfect for slavery, pleasure and to serve people but however<br>they are different than the average normal human being as they have<br>second mouths for bellybuttons and they would sometimes go into<br>meltdown into slimy gooey little creatures if they hurt people. Ace<br>reporter Roger Smith ( Brick Bronsky) is on the verge to find out about<br>the secret of who is behind these sub-humanoids even if he falls for<br>one.Weak but fun sequel to the 1986 cult trash classic from Troma with the<br>usual knockers, self referential material, nudity, and gross out humor<br>with it. I did however thought that girl Roger falls for is a total<br>hottie even though her character had a mouth on her stomach, if your in<br>the mood for goofy no-brain fun then watch this if you liked the<br>original.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Class of Nuke 'Em High Part II: Subhumanoid Meltdown (1991)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Class of Nuke 'Em High 3: The Good, the Bad and the Subhumanoid<br>Class of Nuke 'Em High<br>The Toxic Avenger, Part II<br>Porky's Revenge<br>The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
