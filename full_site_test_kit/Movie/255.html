Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>I can&#39;t vote lower than 1??, 10 March 2007<br>Author:<br>theatreChick1794<br>The first HOND is my favorite Disney film of all time, and definitely<br>ranks in my top five films favs EVER. This film, however, is just a<br>joke to try and entertain children with a watered-down, lighthearted<br>comedy movie that fails to be original or entertaining. The animation<br>is crap, the plot line is simple enough to bore you to death, and the<br>villain is not even a fraction of the greatness Frollo was. All the<br>villain is after is a stupid bell, how boring is that? The characters<br>aren&#39;t even that likable, even Esmeralda, Phoebus, and Quasi don&#39;t<br>share the same spark of personality they had in the first film. They&#39;re<br>basically cardboard cutout characters. The songs are annoying and guess<br>what? The may have killed off Frollo, one of the deepest villains in<br>Disney history, but at least they still have the cute gargoyle<br>sidekicks! (shoot me now.) Don&#39;t bother seeing this film, just don&#39;t.<br>It is absolutely the worst Disney sequel I have ever seen in my entire<br>life.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Hunchback of Notre Dame II (2002) (V)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Their son...<br>ANNAsavvy_x3<br>BORING VILLIAN<br>lshaffer-6<br>Clopin<br>Jeepz<br>Part of me just died<br>Sonic-jj<br>It's sad really....<br>Meadowlark1985<br>it made me cry<br>meche92<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Hunchback of Notre Dame<br>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride<br>Anastasia<br>Rugrats in Paris: The Movie - Rugrats II<br>Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
