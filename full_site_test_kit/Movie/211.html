Not knowing much about<br>Latin America in general, I was not aware of what went on in Haiti -<br>then, and even now. This was such a powerful film portraying Jean<br>Dominique, the Haitian journalist who spoke out against successive<br>dictatorships on Radio Haiti. I feel he resembles how Martin Luther<br>King, in the way he spoke to become the &quot;voice of the people&quot; and his<br>unending passion to pursue freedom, opportunity and human rights for<br>the Haitian peasantry.I recall one part of the film that caught my attention. The foreign<br>soldiers scene discussing &quot;The Battle of Vertieres&quot; that occurred on<br>November 18, 1803. Composed of escaped Haitian slaves form the Haitian<br>Revolutionary Army,demolish Napoleon&#39;s Colonial Forces. Here, Jean<br>Dominique&#39;s father tells him when he&#39;s just a young boy seeing soldiers<br>pass his house, &quot;You are from this land, you are not French, you are<br>not British, you are not American. You are Haitian!&quot; I feel Dominique&#39;s<br>passion to fight for human rights from the elite were rooted in him by<br>his father.Dominique stood for the values of open inquiry, justice and freedom.<br>The documentary provides the world with the insight of this fearless<br>man who wanted to do good in the world. I hope someday his assassins<br>are found and justice is served.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Agronomist (2003)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>What's Your...<br>ANGEL_407<br>Johnathan Demme<br>RosenKratz<br>soundtrack?<br>erincmedley<br>Entertaining, but needs more political context<br>SurrenderToto<br>Best movie about a soil and plant scientist ever...<br>PFEKing<br>Urgent Help!!!<br>blanco353<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Trials of Henry Kissinger<br>American Blackout<br>The Real Malcolm X<br>Paragraph 175<br>Aleut Story<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
