When it is mentioned again at the train station by Ninotchka, she again mistakenly pronounces it as Razinni. It isn't until later in the film that the correct pronunciation is used.<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>Ninotchka:<br>Don't make an issue of my womanhood.<br>more<br>Movie Connections:<br>Referenced in Compagno Don Camillo, Il (1965)<br>more<br>This FAQ is empty.

Her supporting actors, Sig Ruman used every expression he<br>could to portray a fumbling Russian and Bela Lugosi showed the movie<br>industry that he had great acting abilities he was never given a chance show<br>to his many fans.This film shows aspiring actors just how to perform to the highest level of<br>their art.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ninotchka (1939)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>loved it<br>jigova<br>Bela Lugosi<br>OneMind<br>Coldwar Romance<br>Kensith<br>One of 3 most funny movies I ever saw!<br>SpongeAnya_SquarePants<br>110 or 136 min?!<br>azarel<br>Are there a double of Garbo in Ninotchka film?<br>mercecm<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes<br>Casablanca<br>Ruggles of Red Gap<br>Shakespeare in Love<br>Moulin Rouge!<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
