I love Winnie the Pooh and I love watching most of his films<br>but I can safely say that this one is unbearable! Rabbit hates Easter<br>and becomes emotionally saddened about it for a very pointless reason -<br>because he felt left out when everyone else was having fun! The<br>narrator is more of one of the supporting characters and just like<br>everyone else, he acts like a total idiot. Also, I can&#39;t believe people<br>make far too big a deal of &quot;Rabbit&#39;s Rubbish Reason&quot; as I call it. Why<br>can&#39;t they just say &quot;oh, Rabbit, surely you&#39;re not getting into a state<br>over just that! Snap out of it, pal!&quot; instead of &quot;oh, dear, you are<br>unhappy, aren&#39;t you? We honestly didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings,<br>Rabbit. We just wanted Roo to be happy on his first Easter.&quot; At the end<br>of the film we see Rabbit singing the insufferable song &quot;Cos what I<br>like most about Easter&quot; and then gives Roo a hug, Tigger cries<br>emotionally at that touching, tearful moment that&#39;ll touch the hearts<br>of all that see it - (blowing a raspberry) uh, yeah right!!! Honest to<br>GOD! What&#39;s so emotionally moving about having a hug? And, also, what&#39;s<br>so tear-jerking about singing that stupid song? About two years ago mum<br>got it on video from Safeway and I only saw it once. I don&#39;t know where<br>it is now and quite frankly I don&#39;t care! &quot;Winnie the Pooh: Springtime<br>with Roo&quot; is a very cheap, poor film that is a real waste of time.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo (2004) (V)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You<br>Winnie the Pooh &#38; Christmas Too<br>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh<br>Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore<br>Boo to You Too!
