Everyone should know that,<br>specially while watching Airplane 2. In my opinion, Airplane 2 still has the<br>same quality of humor as Airplane does and it only repeats a few jokes. It<br>never seemed repetitive for me, but maybe for most people it can get old to<br>see two movies with the exact same type of humor and the same type of<br>universe and imagery. I thought it was really funny that they went into<br>space this time, and they could have done a lot more science fiction movie<br>related jokes, but they didn't, and I suppose that's okay. I didn't expect<br>it to be as good as the first one, really. Of course the first one was<br>better, but I wouldn't say it was much better. I've seen much worse sequels<br>for comedy movies.<br>I personally thought it did fine as a sequel and I'd recommend it to anyone<br>who liked the first one.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Trivia wrong<br>Wing_nut<br>Which Airplane! movie is this line from?<br>firestongue<br>Could this movie have been rated PG-13......wasn't it originally R?<br>mwplefty<br>I don't mean to sound forward woman<br>camerabugs<br>Jive Talking<br>kcuber<br>So much better than -insert genre- Movie<br>rwood-10<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Airplane!<br>Thumb Wars: The Phantom Cuticle<br>Spaceballs<br>The Ambushers<br>Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
