It had<br>the usual flaws that any 90&#39;s film would have but overall it was a<br>great movie. This film was very close into being perfect. One thing<br>movies like to add is loads of comedy not realizing that comedy takes<br>away from an complete impact. However the movie is made so well that<br>even though I knew who the killer was before I saw the movie, I was<br>still shocked in this movie. The three stars have excellent chemistry<br>and sadly weren&#39;t paired up again. Bobby Deol is a better actor now,<br>but he wasn&#39;t that great in this movie. He has no facial expression and<br>a weak body language. Sad, because his elder brother mastered at facial<br>expression. Kajol was amazing, and surprisingly was given a very little<br>chance to act. However, she proves that four scenes can still let her<br>steal the show. Koirala was excellent. She is given a less meatier role<br>than Kajol, but performs very well as she has more scenes. This role<br>was not given any recognition, but she looked extremely beautiful, and<br>she should portray roles like this. Om Puri and Paresh Rawal were<br>brilliant. Om Puri played an excellent cop, and Paresh Rawal was<br>mesmerizing. The main flaw was that the songs got in the way. The only<br>songs that were portrayed properly were Mere Khabown Mein Tu (In My<br>Dreams Are You), which is a nice song, Yeh Pyar Kya Hai (What is this<br>Love) which had nice choreography and was nice to watch. The other good<br>song was Mushkil Bada Yeh Pyar Hai (The Love is Really Hard) which was<br>a very long song and got boring. Anyways the movie was nice, and is a<br>treat to watch.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Heaven<br>Chicago<br>Gunaah<br>The Hard Word<br>Let Him Have It<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
