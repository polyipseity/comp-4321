The 73-year-old director&#39;s<br>serene meditation on Europe&#39;s landscape after battle has an unusually<br>obvious triptych structure, with each panel (or act) named for one of<br>Dante&#39;s three &quot;kingdoms.&quot; The central, hour-long &quot;Purgatory&quot; of a<br>writers&#39; conference in Sarajevo bridges the opening 10-minute &quot;Hell&quot;<br>and a concluding 10-minute &quot;Heaven.&quot; &quot;Hell&quot; is a sensationally edited<br>found-footage montage that yokes together clips from newsreels and all<br>manner of movies (Alexander Nevsky, Fort Apache, and Kiss Me Deadly).<br>Are these images real? Drawing on the video layering techniques<br>developed in his magisterial Histoire(s) du Cin&eacute;ma, this distressed,<br>bleeding assemblage is something like Godard&#39;s bid for a Guernica&#151;a<br>visceral and formally brilliant evocation of total war.As in Dante, Hell is a tough act to follow. &quot;Reporters always visit the<br>hells, and tourists the paradises! One seldom goes to purgatory,&quot;<br>Godard told. But Sarajevo is a former hell that attracts a particular<br>kind of tourist. JLG appears as his rumpled self to give a talk at a<br>French-sponsored literary conference; other participants include<br>Spanish novelist Juan Goytisolo, Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, and<br>a fictional Israeli journalist (Sarah Adler) carrying a copy of<br>Levinas&#39;s Entre Nous. Like him, she&#39;s concerned with building bridges.<br>So is Godard, although his mainly have to do with metaphor and montage.Despite the absence of Bosnian-speaking subjects, Notre Musique takes<br>as its ruling metaphor Mostar&#39;s Stari Most, the stone bridge that<br>outlived the Ottomans and withstood two world wars until it was<br>pulverized by Croatian artillery in 1993. But Bosnia mostly serves as a<br>backdrop for the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, or Jews<br>and themselves. Godard&#39;s translator, the son of a Jewish-Egyptian<br>Communist, has come to Sarajevo to meet his Israeli niece Olga (Nade<br>Dieu). Not only named for but sounding like a 19th-century Russian<br>heroine, she tells him (in French) that she&#39;s contemplating a form of<br>suicide to protest the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.The heart of the movie is Godard&#39;s lecture (a disquisition on the<br>ethics of montage) and its failure: Hilariously uncertain that he has<br>made his point regarding the (mis-)recognition of the Other, he<br>orchestrates a pan across his expressionless audience. Olga, offscreen,<br>asks how DV mini-cameras might affect the future of cinema. Godard<br>stares impassively for a long minute. The oracle is speechless,<br>although Notre Musique, it should be noted, is shot largely in 35mm and<br>characterized by an austere, Calvinist beauty. The colors are saturated<br>and the contrast pronounced, with figures typically silhouetted against<br>a bright background. The editing is dense. A second viewing shows Olga<br>repeatedly glimpsed on the streets of Sarajevo.However madly aphoristic, filled with close-ups, and populated by<br>serious young women, this is one of Godard&#39;s more documentary films;<br>given his programmatic perversity, he keeps stressing the importance of<br>fiction, fable, and icon. The haunting final movement takes<br>self-martyred Olga to a paradise that, despite the presence of U.S.<br>Marines, strongly resembles the same Swiss landscape where Godard shot<br>his last meditation on the Balkan wars, For Ever Mozart.Too touchy-feely for some hardcore Godardians, Notre Musique is the<br>most lucid of the master&#39;s recent films. More gnarly Godard may be<br>found in Moments Choisis des Histoire(s) du Cin&eacute;ma. An 85-minute<br>distillation of his fin de si&egrave;cle magnum opus, the five-hour,<br>eight-part video Histoire(s) du Cin&eacute;ma, the heavily encoded Moments is<br>another installation in Godard&#39;s long goodbye. The artist merges film<br>and video as well as painting and cinema. Earnest stars rush the camera<br>amid a flickering thaumascope effect. Moments might be an Oscar-night<br>clip-fest doc transmitted from an unknown galaxy.Not half a dozen men<br>have ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their<br>heads. Godard is one of them.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Notre musique (2004)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>meaning of the title ?<br>bettinay-1<br>godard discussion group<br>gloria.monti<br>Music in Musique<br>jnhiller2003<br>Pictures from Heaven section<br>zikanov<br>Pan + Scan DVD?<br>GabrielValley<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>11'09''01 - September 11<br>The Beach<br>The Mambo Kings<br>Benny's Video<br>Guerreros<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
