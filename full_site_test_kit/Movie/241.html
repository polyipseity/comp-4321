Part of the success of the movie lies in<br>the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era.<br>Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard<br>Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the<br>above mentioned qualities, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was photographed by<br>Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did<br>outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired<br>Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has<br>to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because<br>of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee<br>between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance<br>that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really<br>happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so<br>we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it<br>turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of<br>the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences<br>involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and<br>Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work<br>with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant<br>played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is<br>perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture.<br>James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce<br>Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is<br>excellent.&quot;North by Northwest&quot; is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films<br>thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for North by Northwest (1959)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Emil?<br>ka-armour<br>Theatre Tickets!<br>stomaino<br>A Bad1959 Review of 'North by Northwest'<br>ecarle<br>Van Dam's house in Montana -- was it real?<br>riegelsvillegrrrl<br>'The Midpoint Movie' -- And Almost As Important As Psycho<br>ecarle<br>UK trains ad. with NbNW footage<br>swanstep<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Raiders of the Lost Ark<br>Dick Tracy Returns<br>xXx<br>Marathon Man<br>Live and Let Die<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
