Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-<br>you can try, but you can never go home, 1 May 2005<br>Author:<br>Tom (bighouseaz) from United States<br>After a 23 year absence, Zatoichi returns to his home town to find that<br>few remember him. But in the end the village residents will have much<br>to remember him by.Of course Zatoichi is in a sentimental mood. There is a funny scene<br>where Zato mistakenly thinks that the town has set up a big banquet in<br>his honor and he frets over how to greet his guests and thank them.<br>There is a touching scene where Zato comes across a Jizo (Buddha)<br>statue along side a road where he used to play as a child. Jizo is<br>missing his stone head, so Zatoichi gets on hands and knees to find the<br>missing head. In the end he finds the head and replaces it on Jizo's<br>shoulders. Zato visits the grave of his 'aunti' who breast fed him and<br>offers sake (taking a nip himself :) ).The second half of the film is fast paced and has an interesting story.<br>It's a story of greed and the story is being sown by Zatoichi's<br>childhood friend, who has returned to the village at the same time as<br>Zatoichi. Their confrontation is predictable, but Zatoichi takes out a<br>host of yakuza to eventually confront his childhood friend. Overall,<br>it's a compelling story and has a lot of good action.So this film marks the 25th film in a period of 12 years. It's<br>interesting that the series pauses at this point. The next film (and<br>last) will be released in 1989. I would rank Zatoichi Conspiracy higher<br>than several of the earlier films in the series, but the Japanese<br>public must have had enough by this point. Good work Katsu!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Shin Zat&#244;ichi monogatari: Kasama no chimatsuri (1973)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Shin Zat&#244;ichi: Yabure!
