I admit this movie is manipulative, and probably exaggerated for<br>purposes of drama, but what based-on-a-true story movies aren&#39;t? At<br>least it goes after the right things: a father having custody of his<br>kids, rather than them being forced to live in an &quot;institution.&quot;The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which,<br>in the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case.<br>&quot;Desmond Doyle&quot; (Pierce Brosnan) is the loving father whose wife runs<br>off one day with another man, leaving him with three little kids and<br>little visible means of support. Since he didn&#39;t have enough finances,<br>the government makes the kids wards of the state and places them in<br>Catholic schools-homes (institutions?).On that Catholic, or &quot;religious,&quot; angle, you get a lot of positive and<br>negative scenes here. You have a bad, nasty almost sadistic nun &quot;Sister<br>Brigid,&quot; but the others are fine caring ladies, as they should be.<br>Overall, however, you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film and<br>it&#39;s mostly good. Of course, that faith was more out in the open in the<br>&#39;50s than today, but it was inspiring to see in many parts.Brosnan is excellent in the lead role, a man everyone can identify<br>with: a loving but flawed man. He drinks too much, he swears, he<br>doesn&#39;t have a steady job but he has great heart and has great<br>determination to the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him in<br>this story. I think it&#39;s the best role he has ever played, far better<br>than his superficial James Bond or thieves roles he normally plays.But<br>nobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur), one<br>of Doyle&#39;s three kids and the one that is focused upon here. (The two<br>little brothers are not given much screen time, for some reason.)<br>Brosnan&#39;s allies in here - the two lawyers (played by Stephen Rea and<br>Aiden Quinn) are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a rugged<br>ex-barrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had the<br>best role for the supporting actors.This is such an involving story, one that you really care about the<br>people, it can bring a tear or two in the end, but what&#39;s wrong with<br>that? When you are finished watching this film, you feel good.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Evelyn (2002)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>irish accents<br>greys_obsessy<br>A Evelyn Music Video<br>but448<br>WORST BOND MOVIE EVER!!<br>bonsai_midget<br>My explination on why the movie was more about 'Evelyn' and not the boys<br>DV96<br>Why is this film called Evelyn?<br>Lalena1<br>Very good but...<br>oc7000<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Mommie Dearest<br>The Game of Their Lives<br>Catch Me If You Can<br>Superman<br>Chariots of Fire<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
