It's like Joe<br>Eszterhas picked up his old &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; script and simply started<br>changing some of the characters names and added or changed just some<br>few situations. They pathetically tried to surprise the audience with<br>some plot twist that you could see from miles away. Halfway trough the<br>movie I already knew who the person was they were chasing. That means<br>either two things; I'm smart or the writer is just stupid, I think that<br>the second one sounds more probable. And what was with the final plot<br>twist at the end? That really didn't made sense as did the entire movie<br>that was just filled with some major plot holes.Also the style was very incoherent. Only the second half of the movie<br>the movie gets a nice visual style with some good camera-work. Still the movie is perfectly watchable for one simple reason; The car<br>chases. The car chases and crashes are really spectacular like you<br>could expect from director William Friedkin, the guy who brought us<br>&quot;The French Connection&quot;. Although it is a bit strange that no matter<br>how hard the cars crash into thing, in the next shot the car always<br>looks tip-top again.Watchable but most certainly not recommendable soft-erotic/thriller.5/10<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Jade (1995)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Friedkin the true writer?WTF<br>mp989<br>Subliminal images and messages?<br>sojiroseta52<br>WIDESCREEN VERSION<br>thx11384eb<br>Did anyone really liked it?<br>artemiss_84<br>Different versions, aspect ratio, lousy dvdetc Help<br>mp989<br>Angie Everhart<br>ladyorthetygr<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Basic Instinct<br>The Last Seduction<br>Magnum Force<br>Body Heat<br>Presumed Innocent<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
