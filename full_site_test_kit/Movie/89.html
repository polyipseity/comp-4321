I was wrong. A good cast (Roy Scheider as the president) didn&#39;t help it any. The<br>story had every conceivable possible worst-case scenario that could<br>take place in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of it could<br>POSSIBLY happen! True -- the kidnapping of the President could only be accomplished with<br>the inside help of a traitor in the Secret Service (ala Air Force One),<br>but everything they depicted regarding the FOOTBALL and the<br>helplessness of our country if were to fall into enemy hands is<br>ludicrous to the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the President can<br>fully over-ride our missile control. The case is only used to relay<br>orders. In this situation, our system would have completely deleted the<br>codes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing<br>couldn&#39;t happen -- there would not have been a missile launch because<br>the silo-crews would have been instructed not to (communications<br>include a hardwired system). There are just too many safe-guards to<br>prevent such a thing from happening. True, film&#39;s like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave some credibility to<br>the concept of us losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this film goes too<br>far and fails to suspend my concept of the unbelievable. And that makes<br>the experience a waste of the viewer&#39;s time. This film is a failure.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chain of Command (2000)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Tennis Chick<br>tweek_kicks_ass<br>Resued footage<br>trog-6<br>Sung Hi<br>mastrolilli<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Tomorrow Never Dies<br>The Sum of All Fears<br>The World Is Not Enough<br>Dick Tracy Returns<br>Escape from New York<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
