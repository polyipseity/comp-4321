It just<br>never lets up, and it has Stallone at the top of his game. Its comic strip<br>stuff, and is much less credible than First Blood. I don't care about that<br>though, you want a serious film then watch The Deer Hunter or Platoon, but<br>if you want to see a superbly made action film watch this. After the events<br>of First Blood, John Rambo is in prison but gets released to be sent back to<br>Vietnam to take pictures of a pow camp to get proof that there is still<br>American pow's there. But he is double-crossed by his superiors when he<br>tries to take some pow's out with him, he wasn't meant to do that, he was<br>ordered to only take photos, so he's left behind to be captured , imprisoned<br>and tortured by those oh so nasty RUSSIANS! Sly really had it in for the<br>reds in 1985 after this film, he sent Rocky out to Russia to beat up that<br>other nasty Russian Ivan Drago! It must have been what the people wanted as<br>this and Rocky IV were two of the biggest smashes of the year. Steven<br>Berkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his role<br>in the James Bond film Octopussy, he does it well though, he was one of<br>Hollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's, you might remember him in<br>Beverly Hills Cop, which was a film initially intended for........Sylvester<br>Stallone! This movie has just been giving the DVD special edition treatment,<br>buy it, and get yourself one of the greatest action flms ever<br>made.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Stallone actually directed First Blood part II<br>Wisconsin_Film_Student<br>Who would win?
