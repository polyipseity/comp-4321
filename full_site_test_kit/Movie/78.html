Sinbad plays a mentally unstable mailman, with<br>apparently a great deal of free time on his hands, who is every bit as<br>determined to recover the Turboman doll as Arnold. Before long, a<br>little last-minute holiday shopping for each father turns into a race<br>against time, and each other, to get his respective hands on the<br>holiday-season&#39;s &quot;hottest&quot; toy. The late Phil Hartman also co-stars as<br>the ultimate sleaze-ball neighbor. Jingle all the Way is complete<br>mindless nonsense, but good chemistry among its leads and tasteful<br>humor makes it both worthwhile and anything but boring.Rating: 2.5 out of 4 stars<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Jingle All the Way (1996)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Funniest LineEver--<br>chrisgazzara<br>A good movie<br>adm8720<br>Just voted 'worst christmas movie of all time'<br>thorbjorn_moe<br>SOUNDTRACK<br>bujo8-2<br>I was actually in this movie<br>comdanj<br>Minneapolis references<br>keithslininger<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>A Christmas Story<br>The Incredibles<br>Home Alone 3<br>Sky High<br>Hook<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
