Since the discovery of their existence they have been regarded with fear, suspicion, often hatred. Across the planet, debate rages. Are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain or simply a new species of humanity fighting for their share of the world? Either way it is a historical fact: Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute.<br>more<br>Movie Connections:<br>References Werewolf of London (1935)<br>more<br>Soundtrack:<br>Evolution Exhibit<br>more<br>This FAQ is empty.

Alan Cumming&#39;s &#39;NightCrawler&#39; was a<br>revelation and the subtext of accepting homosexuality/being a latent<br>Mutant was beyond great. The coming out seen with iceman and his family<br>is phucking exceptional and Wolverine claiming he&#39;s their art teacher<br>was perfect comedy. The brian cox character was greatly cast as was the<br>ever so phucking beautiful Kelly Hu...The opening of this film set the tone and the movie took off running<br>and never once slowed down. Seeing Bryan and his crafty ways of<br>revealing characters from future films by threading them in was<br>seamless and eloquent. I am truly disappointed that Bryan&#39;s name is not<br>attached to the third, i feel as though superman is going to be a<br>superdud and he should&#39;ve stuck with this.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for X2 (2003)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Wolverine<br>dearg_ghrain<br>Does anyone know....<br>lillithshallreign2<br>Your fav sequals of all time?<br>elvis-pretzel<br>Nightcrawler....what's his level?<br>scary_poppins88<br>hottest X-men man<br>phoenix_sophie<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>X-Men: The Last Stand<br>X-Men<br>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines<br>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King<br>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
