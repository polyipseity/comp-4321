Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-<br>A Sweet, warm-hearted, and subtle comedy, 20 September 2002<br>Author:<br>LaChantefleurie from USA<br>One of the things I like about this movie is its...lack of obnoxiousness.<br>Other comedies throw their scenes in your face with little tact and no<br>subtlety, but not so with this movie. Not to say that it isn't funny. It's<br>absolutely hilarious! But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthood<br>is the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters have<br>nuanced, complicated, and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REAL<br>PEOPLE, and unlike many of the one-faceted characters seen in movies<br>today.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius,<br>Martin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere, conforming<br>perfectly to his role, and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch for<br>great appearances by Tom Hulce, perhaps best known as Amadeus (poor guy,<br>where'd his career go?) and a very young Joaquin Phoenix as<br>Gary.All in all, a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a<br>9/10!!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Parenthood (1989)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Notice link to St. Louis + Missouri?<br>serpno11<br>Garry<br>RowerChicka<br>question<br>whenbersattack<br>lost retainer<br>sruddy2002<br>Zachary La Voy ....Justin Buckman<br>amyk479<br>Picture pick-up goof!<br>ta421sbtrhalf<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Mrs. Doubtfire<br>Yours, Mine and Ours<br>Terms of Endearment<br>Riding in Cars with Boys<br>Little Miss Sunshine<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
