Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-<br>It's Just Plain Funny, 22 August 2001<br>Author:<br>Ben Hunt (rexodus) from Danville, IL<br>Is it dumb? Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that<br>are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also<br>satirizing old stereotypes about &quot;Dark Africa.&quot; Is it immature and and<br>gross<br>and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is<br>funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene<br>where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading<br>up<br>to a Buddhist temple? (&quot;It was RIGHT there!&quot;) Or the slideshow in which<br>Ace's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just<br>hilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish<br>set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its<br>comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented<br>in-and-of-itself<br>as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra<br>mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (&quot;Stop hittin' yourself! Stop<br>hittin yourself!&quot;) And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through<br>the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and<br>utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely<br>satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just<br>for cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him,<br>pulls<br>out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's<br>milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked<br>the Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully<br>realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something<br>mystical<br>and poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being<br>annoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie.<br>I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will<br>achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Favorite Quote!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!<br>iFkinHATEbooks<br>Favorite Jim Carey Movie?<br>Johnv711<br>Ace Ventura 3<br>PsychlOps<br>Wachati Princess<br>mangemoi69<br>What is<br>bubblicious95124<br>the song?<br>Sharpzy<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Me, Myself &#38; Irene<br>Dumb &#38; Dumber<br>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps<br>The Nutty Professor<br>Get Over It<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
