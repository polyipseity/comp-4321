Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>Fantastic Factory: Second assault, 2 December 2001<br>Author:<br>Hellraiser-1 from Cartagena,Spain<br>After &quot;Faust&quot; the producers Julio Fern&aacute;ndez and Brian Yuzna together with<br>director Jack Sholder decided to offer us one of those typical monsters<br>movies normally direct to video although in this case, obviously it was<br>released at the theaters. The film was very well advertised in TV but<br>unfortunately it was a complete flop at the box office(Less than 50<br>million<br>pesetas for more than 100 copies), but despite that and even recognizing<br>that it is a quite weak movie I prefer this to the mentioned &quot;Faust&quot;. The<br>plot is typical but at least it has more sense and less holes than<br>Fantastic<br>Factory&acute;s first movie and the acting was also a bit better, so people<br>didn&acute;t<br>laugh at the theater(In &quot;Faust&quot; as I said they were frequently doing<br>so).For<br>&quot;Arachnid&quot; I think that the producers had a clearer idea of what they<br>wanted<br>to do, a typical B movie similar to those B fantastic movies that Filmax<br>has<br>been distributing in video during all its existence something like<br>&quot;Spiders&quot;<br>or &quot;Crocodile&quot; with sometimes bad special effects and where the job by<br>Sholder is far from being so inspired as in &quot;Hidden&quot; or &quot;A nightmare on<br>Elm<br>Street 2&quot; but nevertheless the film has some good points and Sholder gets<br>one memorable scene about the killing of a guy by a group of mutant ticks<br>which is the best of the movie and which is, no doubt, the best goric<br>scene<br>that I have seen lately.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Arachnid (2001)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Just saw on Sci-Fi, and the end...?<br>ops_kt<br>What in the world?<br>lumpywumpkins<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Cannibal Holocaust<br>Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid<br>King Kong<br>King Kong<br>The Mysterious Pilot<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
