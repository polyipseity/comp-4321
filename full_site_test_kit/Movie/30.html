You may not understand what I mean<br>by<br>that but I'll explain.I am pretty young (15 yrs. old) but mature to some my age! I love &quot;love<br>stories&quot;. And on average now you usually see the young/beautiful (in some<br>ppl's opinions) people in love movies! And to see Diane &amp; Jack play these<br>roles.. and basically show that even when you are at that age how devine<br>it<br>is :) In my opinion I think Diane is beautiful also. My point is: I really<br>enjoy seeing the older couples sometimes on screen... to know what my<br>parents exactly go there &amp; feel (but never tell me) like that. B/c that isreality and truth -not just your young love, we don't stay young forever<br>lol! But yes I know there are movies that have older couples, but they are<br>usually just there. I mean on average movies most of the time excuse the<br>fact that how much in love they still are (which I adore)... especially<br>like<br>this movie!Alright on to the movie -I have read what people have been saying that<br>Something's Gotta Give is predictable. Uhm well of course, I knew how it<br>KINDA baselined to be from trailers also. But come on how many love<br>stories<br>do that?? They end up falling in love.. then have troubles.. at the end<br>get<br>together! A LOT. But to those who are reading this right now: IT IS NOT<br>*ALL* PREDICTABLE!!I love Keanu Reeves in this movie! He is very sweet and truly in love.. he<br>was just right. I actually enjoyed him the best (besides Diane &amp; Jack's<br>love). Why you might ask? Hm.. let me just say Keanu played a better guy<br>then Jack (him being a young ladies man/player).But all in all I really liked it! At times (cus of its length) it may drag<br>a<br>little, but that is it's only faults. It has enough humor/love/sweetness,<br>lol, to make it a great movie!! It all depends on your tastes too (I've<br>heard from various ppl that mainly it's a married woman's type of movie).<br>But anyone could like it I believe, so at your very least... you can rent<br>it, hopefully then it'll be led to buying it :DI give it a 8.5/10! *Alaina<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Something's Gotta Give (2003)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Nicholson's cell phone<br>uberpike<br>Marin's Husband and Pregnancy<br>NicoliHP<br>have you ..?<br>nrjetik81<br>edited for TV<br>snowboardgirl290<br>the absolutely BEST quote of this movie is missing in the quotes section<br>alvaro2908-1<br>Contraception......<br>my_i_me_mine<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Notebook<br>Saving Face<br>Something New<br>The Phantom of the Opera<br>Playboy Video Centerfold: The Dahm Triplets<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
