Joe is an<br>unbelieveable player &amp; a true gentleman. He is in a class of his own. Seeing<br>him play live is a spectacle to behold. Pure Awesome Power!<br>SatchRules!<br>Steve Vai &amp; Eric Johnson are great players as well,but Joe has the big edge<br>in my books. I wish there had have been more songs on the disc but what was<br>on it still makes up for an enjoyable concert of some of the best guitar<br>players in the world today.<br>For all you &quot;Satch&quot; fans, check out his upcoming DVD release of &quot;Joe<br>Satriani-Live In San Francisco&quot; coming out on Aug 21st 2001....It's going to<br>be nuts!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for G3 Live in Concert (1996) (V)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Last Waltz<br>My Generation<br>Woodstock<br>Bruce Dickinson: Dive, Dive, Dive<br>Live Aid<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
