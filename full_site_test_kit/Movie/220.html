A US flag is visible to his right, and the field (with the stars) is visible. The stars are in staggered rows, meaning it is a 50 star US flag. A 48-star flag, as in use in 1929, would have even rows of stars (six rows of eight).<br>more<br>Quotes:<br>[1936: Germany is rapidly re-arming.

Having been a leading figure in political<br>life from 1903 to 1929, and risen to such posts as Home Secretary,<br>First Lord of the Admiralty, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill<br>was cast adrift when the Tories under Stanley Baldwin lost office to<br>the Labor Party of Ramsay MacDonald in a general election. For awhile<br>Baldwin and Churchill were sitting next to each other on the front<br>opposition bench in the House of Commons, but Baldwin was not that<br>happy about this. He knew that Churchill was a potential Tory rival for<br>leadership, and Baldwin wanted to control those who would succeed him<br>while he held power.The series did not quite explain Churchill's weakness here - in 1903,<br>when he first made his name in politics, Churchill was a Tory M.P. This<br>was traditional, because his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had also<br>been a Tory M.P. But Lord Randolph had been a maverick, who built up a<br>block of Tories (one was future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour) called<br>the Fourth Party, and had done considerable damage to Lord Salisbury's<br>party in the 1880s. Lord Randolph did end up as Chancellor of Exchequer<br>in 1887, but a political showdown miscalculation with Salisbury<br>finished his career (a case of syphilis also ruined it). Winston took<br>his father's independence to heart. He announced his rejection of the<br>Tory policies of his day, and &quot;crossed the aisle&quot; to sit with the<br>Liberal Party. Denounced for his treason to his father's party, Winston<br>actually rose to power from 1903 to 1923 as a Liberal Party leader. But<br>in 1916 there was a power struggle between the Liberal Prime Minister<br>(Asquith) and his successor (Lloyd George). Winston sided with Lloyd<br>George, and this was fine while a complicated half-Liberal/half-Tory<br>coalition existed. But it collapsed in 1922. The following year Winston<br>announced his disillusion with Liberal Party politics and crossed back<br>to the Tories. Baldwin accepted it, as Churchill was experienced and<br>smart. He made him Chancellor of Exchequer in his 1924-1929<br>administration. But Baldwin (as I said) did not trust Churchill.The series never makes this clear, although Baldwin is shown to be a<br>smart politician (Winston later acknowledged that Stanley was the most<br>formidable politician he ever met). It follows how Baldwin managed for<br>most of the 1930s to manipulate the weakling MacDonald (who split his<br>party on a coalition government in 1931) to keep Churchill out of the<br>government, and then to keep him out of the Tory government of 1935-37.<br>Some of this was due to Churchill's own blundering - he opposed<br>Baldwin's willingness to work with Gandhi on eventual Indian<br>independence, and he supported the pro-Nazi Edward VIII in the<br>abdication crisis. Baldwin left office in 1937, having chosen Nevil<br>Chamberlain his successor. In retrospect Baldwin was one of Britain's<br>most successful Prime Ministers, except he could not move as fast as he<br>wanted in rearming in the face of Nazi aggression (he did do what he<br>could, but the Labour Party and the Tories were not as willing to rearm<br>as he was).Chamberlain would also keep Churchill at bay, but he came acropper due<br>to Hitler's aggressions and Munich. But Churchill would not be called<br>back until Britain would return to war in 1939, and would not become<br>Prime Minister until 1940.The series was fair in showing that Baldwin was a clever political<br>manipulator. And Eric Porter did a marvelous job as Baldwin's right<br>hand man (and successor) Chamberlain, reminding the audience that had<br>it been a peaceful period Chamberlain would have reformed the British<br>education system and the tax system. He just was tragically unprepared<br>to handle Hitler (who indeed was?). Best was Robert Hardy, whose<br>Churchill was the best ever done dramatically on television. Not only<br>his political miscalculations were shown, but his financial problems,<br>his growing literary work (remember, he won the Nobel Prize for<br>Literature as a historian), and his family problems with wife<br>Clementine (Sian Philips), who had an affair, and his son Randolph, who<br>was too undisciplined to have a political career. One hopes the series<br>will be shown again someday.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for &#34;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&#34; (1981) (mini)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Gandhi<br>The Gathering Storm<br>The Last Emperor<br>Disraeli<br>The Final Cut<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
