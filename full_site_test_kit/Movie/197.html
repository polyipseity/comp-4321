But SE7EN it ain't..., 15 April 2004<br>Author:<br>Freedomisanillusion from Tasmania, Australia<br>Despite my love of Angelina Jolie, I must say that Taking Lives wasted<br>a lot of good opportunity.Given that they invented an entirely new lead character, we can't<br>really compare this to the book, so let's look at it as a movie of it's<br>own right.Jolie plays Illeana Scott, a somewhat strange FBI agent who is called<br>up to Canada to investigate the grisly murders of several young men,<br>all whom have had their identities stolen by the killer. New to the<br>scene is witness James Costa, Ethan Hawke, who soon grows to have an<br>attachment to Scott.At turns formulaic and down right rip off (the credits are far too<br>similar to be called a homage to SE7EN), Taking Lives is a very<br>enjoyable piece of work.Beautifully shot, the film wallows in its moods. It knows that it can<br>be creepy, but it wears it out on its sleeves.Angelina is on top form as Scott, although its a shame that the movie<br>does stoop to the need for quick-sex-scene-with-unnecessary-titty-shot.Ethan Hawke is bearable as Costa, although he and Jolie have very<br>little chemistry.Other players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and Jean<br>Hughes-Angalade are also quite good.The film does have its highs: excellent cinematography, creepy sinister<br>mood, two fantastic adrenaline-jump moments that I never saw coming.<br>But it also has one FATAL flaw, and that is that anyone who has seen<br>any piece of film or television before will be able to guess who the<br>killer is. Still, a fun movie nevertheless.7/10 If you get the chance to see it in the cinema, watch people's<br>reactions to the 'scissors-scene'. I was amazed to see hoe genuinely<br>horrified even the most hardened viewers in my cinema were.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Taking Lives (2004)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>why angelina didn't think Ethan wasn't the serial killers at first ?SPOI<br>honsheung18<br>The Poster<br>tarmikosPnB<br>paul dano?<br>kayte_the_myspace_addict<br>the sexiest scene of Ang?<br>honsheung18<br>'Love' Scene<br>seewhatimesdone<br>Am I the only one?????<br>Masked_Superhero<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Sin City<br>Copycat<br>American Psycho<br>Basic Instinct<br>Identity<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
