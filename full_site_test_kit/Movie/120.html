They drive me up a wall. Same with<br>romance books. But perhaps because this was romantic in a weird way, I<br>did really like it.Swain plays a down-and-out white trash girl in Virginia, married to a<br>creep named Edgar who robs stores to keep themselves afloat. They don't<br>give you a background as to why she ever married this creep, but the<br>bloom has worn off the rose and she just wants to get away from him<br>now.She's in love with a very pale young man who is a lawyer in their small<br>Southern town. He's a big fish in a small pond and more to offer her<br>then she's ever seen in her whole white trash life.Edgar also has a best friend, a guy named &quot;Flowers&quot;, for what reason I<br>can't imagine, who hangs around Edgar and his wife all the time.<br>Flowers is infatuated with Inez, Edgar's wife, but she finds him<br>repulsive. He really is, at first--you have to look hard through all<br>the dirt and bad clothing and beard to recognize pretty nice-looking<br>Ari Verveen.Edgar knows Inez is in love with someone else and after a fight,<br>decides to keep her prisoner in her own house by chaining her to her<br>bed at night and to the sofa daily, with Flowers standing guard while<br>Edgar goes and does whatever it is he does.Inez manages to convince Flowers to help her to get away from Edgar by<br>murdering him for her. He doesn't really need a lot of convincing,<br>since he wants her for himself.These people are completely amoral and trashy, but there is still a<br>beautiful kind of poetic romance to Flower's love for Inez. I loved the<br>movie. Even if you hate romances, you may find it great too.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Briar Patch (2003)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>I have a doubt about flowers...<br>aracelis23<br>HOT!!<br>otma1918<br>Strange yet hypnotizing<br>dixie_lowell<br>Inez's Lover<br>tmo1909<br>How does that monolouge near the end go?!?!?!<br>steviequeen5106<br>I love this movie!<br>em420<br>more<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>The Count of Monte Cristo<br>The Hard Word<br>The Two Jakes<br>Blue Streak<br>Heaven<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
