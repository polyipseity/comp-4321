Though he's totally<br>unrecognizable with a long beard, Stallone does an exceptionally good<br>performance because unlike his other cop roles, such as Ray Tango from<br>&quot;Tango and Cash&quot;, Sly doesn't portray a cocky character, which makes it very<br>realistic. However, our hero doesn't show his muscles in this flick, but, it<br>proves that you don't have to be brawny to be a tough guy.<br>Hauer is also perfect, playing what he does best, an oily villian. He might<br>look very suave at first in this film, but when he shows his true colors,<br>you better watch out. Last but not least is Billy Dee Williams, who does a<br>cool Roger Murtaughesque cop who relies on his partner Sly to do the<br>job.If you're in the mood for suspense and good chase scenes, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; is<br>your gameplan. Look out for the great conclusion. It might cause you a great<br>deal of shock!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Nighthawks (1981)<br>Recent Posts (updated daily)User<br>Yeah!
