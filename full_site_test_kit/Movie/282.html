Add the first question.<br>(Comment on this title)<br>Never see this, 23 March 2007<br>Author:<br>wolfecastle86 from United States<br>Let me start off by saying I love Blue Seed. On many occasions, I have<br>watched the entire show in one sitting. So when I found out ADV was<br>going to release Blue Seed Beyond, I was pretty dang excited. But all<br>that changed when I rented this. First of all, the animation quality is<br>TERRIBLE. It resembles the TV show in no way. It was animated the new<br>way with a computer, but it actually looks worse than the TV series.<br>Secondly, the story is lousy. Two episodes is way too short to revive<br>an enemy that they fought for 26 episodes, and moving it to America<br>made it even worse because part of the charm of the original was it was<br>a Japanese legend. All the are characters back, but they do not act the<br>same and they are almost aren&#39;t even used in the story. The villain is<br>laughably bad, and if you watch the dubbed version, you won&#39;t even find<br>it funny but unbearable. And to add insult to injury, they throw in a<br>third episode that has nothing to do with the series. It involves a<br>terrorist planting a bomb in a hot spring where the characters are, and<br>if the level of the water changes, it goes off. It seemed like a rip<br>off of Burn Up, and had nothing to do with Blue Seed. It wasn&#39;t funny,<br>it wasn&#39;t dramatic, and even the fan service (which they obviously<br>wrote the episode for) wasn&#39;t good or interesting. Even though I pride<br>myself on not being a troll or arguing with trolls, I honestly cannot<br>say enough bad things about this OAV. Just rewatch all your old blue<br>seed tapes and do not even think about this, for it might as well not<br>exist.<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Aokushimitama blue seed 2 (1997)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>Rakusho!
