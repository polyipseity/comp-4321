She can also quote Latin tags and<br>Shakespeare with colloquial ease.The stuffy head of the firm, Mr. Pym,<br>is<br>played by Peter Pratt, well known to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan buffs as the comic<br>lead at the D'Oyly Carte several generations ago.The ubiquitous Peter Bowles plays the villainous Major Milligan as a<br>dope<br>dealer to the &quot;bright young things&quot; who still knows when to apologize for<br>rudeness. Mark Eden continues his role as Chief Inspector Parker, now<br>Wimsey's brother-in-law since marrying into the family after the &quot;Clouds<br>of<br>Witness&quot; case. If I cannot warm up to Lady Mary (Rachel Herbert), it is<br>perhaps because of her smugness that tries to be charming but (for me)<br>just<br>misses.Possibly the best realized character is Bridget Armstrong's Dian de<br>Momerie, the fading sexpot who knows she is doomed by her associates, her<br>drug taking, and the ravages of time. Armstrong turns what could have been<br>an utterly cliched role into a sympathetic and believable<br>one.And of course, Ian Carmichael is the same bubbling amateur sleuth of<br>the<br>first two mysteries, always ready to apologize for forgetting he has<br>advantages over most of the others.The plot combines a simple whodunit with a complex howsitdun; and if<br>you<br>pay close attention to the most seemingly inconsequential lines in the<br>first<br>episodes, you will appreciate all the more the solution in the last one. I<br>will reveal none of the plot here, except to say it is a lot of<br>fun.The production budget is below that of the Poirot series, but the<br>period<br>feel is just as good. By the way, when Wimsey (in disguise) is compared<br>with<br>Bertie Wooster, the script writer might be indulging in an inside joke:<br>Ian<br>Carmichael did play Wooster in a series on British TV and that association<br>nearly cost him getting Wimsey after he himself suggested it to the powers<br>that be!<br>Was the above comment useful to you?<br>more<br>Discuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for &#34;Murder Must Advertise&#34; (1973) (mini)<br>If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:<br>&#34;The Nine Tailors&#34;<br>Secret Agent<br>An Unsuitable Job for a Woman<br>&#34;Cadfael&#34;<br>&#34;Inspector Morse&#34;<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>IMDb User Rating:<br>Add a recommendation |<br>Show more recommendations<br>You may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.
